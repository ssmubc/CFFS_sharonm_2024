# Climate-Friendly Food Sustainability Labeling Project 2022-2023

The Climate-Friendly Food Sustainability (CFFS) labelling is carried out on four sites, three of which are for UBC Food Services and the last one for AMS. 
- UBCFS: Open Kitchen, Gather, Feast
- AMS: Flavour Lab

Although the labelling process is similar between UBCFS and AMS, there are some differences due to different input sources. The detailed explanation for UBCFS and AMS are written in their respective folders.
