# Climate-Friendly Food Sustainability Labeling Project 2023-2024  
Coded by: CFFS Data Analyst, Sharon Marfatia  

The Climate-Friendly Food Sustainability (CFFS) labelling is carried out on four sites, three of which are for UBC Food Services and the last one for AMS. 
- UBCFS: Open Kitchen, Gather, Feast
- AMS: Gallery

Although the labelling process is similar between UBCFS and AMS, there are some differences due to different input sources. The detailed explanation for UBCFS and AMS are written in their respective folders. All data can be found under **data** folder.
