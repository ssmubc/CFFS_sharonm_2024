Notes:

1. There are 11.36Kg in 25 Lbs. Cases of Chow Mein Noodles come from Fresh Point in 25 Lbs boxes. 

2. From Freshpoint we also get processed and unprocessed vegetables in 5 Lbs bags. This is why the &quot;Bean Sprouts&quot; and &quot;Julienne Vegetables&quot; are in those increments. 

Prep:

- Thaw Chow Mein Noodles if need be. If they need to be ordered, they can be ordered prior to 10:AM from Freshpoint for an afternoon (same day) delivery, but they will most likely come in frozen. It is best to thaw out these noodles a day in advance or more.

- If the noodles need to be thawed in a hurry, the Combi Oven and its steam setting can be employed.

- Once the Noodles are malleable, break them apart (they come in a large block), and tray them up on large Sheet Trays. Then, as evenly as possible, disperse the remaining ingredients over them for seasoning, flavour, and texture. 

- Steam again. Put into service trays - typically Hotel Pans or Half Hotel Inserts - and hold for service. It&apos;s best not to hold these for too long, however, of all of the starches - the Chow Mein does not degrade as quickly as others. That said - do not use this as an excuse to do off too much in advance.

Any questions? - Ask Chef...</Recipe>

Method:

1. Zest and juice your 2 lemons.

2. Finely chop dill.

3. Process Cucumbers. These should be pulsed in the RoboCoupe. PULSED - NOT LEFT ON TO BECOME A SOUP. What you want is something about the consistency of a small dice. When this is done, transfer this mixture into a bowl with Cheese Cloth. RING OUT AS MUCH WATER AS YOU CAN. THIS WATER IS DELICIOUS. I RECOMMEND DRINKING IT FOR ITS ELECTROLYTE PROPERTIES. Unfortunately, it just doesn&apos;t belong in the Yoghurt in this recipe, as it would turn into Cacic.

4. Combine lemon juice and garlic. Let sit for 10 minutes. Salt this mixture to &quot;cook out&quot; the garlic as much as possible.

5. Fold all ingredients into one another. Taste for Salinity, Acidity, and add honey if the Sweetness needs a little kick.

NOTES: It&apos;s important to note that this is an opportunity for using old or slightly old Cucumber! For instance: look at the recipe for Taboulleh Salad Mix - Cucumber cores should be saved, and then processed and strained in Cheese Cloth for this recipe - otherwise it will be too watery.

In Turkey, there is a dish known as Cacic - a watery version of Tzatziki. The ingredients are more or less the same. What we know as Tzatziki is actually made with Labneh, which is pressed Yoghurt. Since we use regular Yoghurt in this recipe, we have to limit the amount of water content in it, otherwise it will be an undesirable AND low-quality product.

Allergens: EGG

Method:

1. Prepare all Mise En Place items that are dry, and combine. Sift together if you have time.

2. Add Egg, and 50% of the water, and mix with a whisk. 

3. Then, add the vinegar, and continue mixing. A chemical reaction will occur at this point between the vinegar and baking soda. 

4.If necessary, add the remaining water. Otherwise, do not, and let the mixture be by itself. It should be roughly the consistency of soft serve ice cream.

NOTE: This batter should be stored in the freezable containers in the Vegetable Containers, meant for squeeze bottles and other things that stand at room temperature.

[This is where I would normally write &quot;Label/Date/Store!&quot;, but since this is made several times per day, and never stored overnight - the container NOTE was written instead.]

- Mandoline Shallots into thin rings - Approx. 2mm.

- Created a Salt/Water Brine at 10% salt (100g Salt: 1000ml Water). Soak mandolined Shallots in Brine for 10 minutes. Rinse once with clean water, and let rest for 20 minutes.

- At 325-350F, fry Shallots until golden. Shallots will continue cooking once you take them out - and set them on a tray lined with paper towel. IMPORTANT: as soon as you take the Shallots out of the fryer, and onto their blotting surface of paper towel, you will need to move them around so that they don&apos;t clump up and form balls or nests (which, once dried, will not come apart easy). THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GETTING A GOOD PRODUCT.

Method:
1. Gather All Ingredients
2. Char onions, ginger, leek whites, daikon and cabbage in that order. 
3. While your veggies are charing, fill your kettle with 60L and pop in the Kombu and let it steep in warm water for 30 minutes. Take the Kombu out and save for Miso Soup.
4. Sautee your charred ginger and garlic. Add onions, leeks and celery.
5. Add sauteed veggies to the kettle and start filling with the rest of the water, leaving room for the Daikon and Cabbage. - Start heating up kettle to boil.
6. While the kettle is coming to temp, add Umami Dust - and any MUSHROOM ENDS that may be around. Some tomato ends are acceptable too.
7. Once the Daikon and Cabbage are done charring, cut into large chunks.
8. When Broth comes to a boil, turn it down to a very low simmer and add the daikon, cabbage and nori sheets. Season a bit at this stage too, as it helps draw out the flavour of the veggies.
9. If you are leaving the broth over night, you can add all the leek ends and any random cilantro/parsley/green onion ends to the broth while on low heat. If you are finishing it on the same day, then add the green ends at the end and let steep for 30 min before straining etc...

To finish.

1. Scoop all the veggies out.
2. Re-up with water and bring to a boil.
3. Turn down the kettle and add add 1 jug of soy sauce, taste and add more salt/pepper as needed.
4. Put through fine strainer and cool.

	<Recipe id="P-44082" image="">ALLERGENS: WHEAT, GLUTEN

Prep:

- Take the Coriander Seeds, Cumin Seeds, Ajwain Seeds, Black Pepper and Garam Masala - and toast, then grind in the Vitamix into a fine powder. The toasting, as mentioned in other recipes, is key to developing flavour and aroma.

- Amchur Powder is not a spice, but a powder made of green mango. It should not be toasted. Opinions differ on this, but - for this recipe, do not toast this ingredient.

- Normally this recipe would be made into a paste with lemon juice and a small amount of water. We use this as a more dry rub, in combination with alread-wet ingredients like potatoes that have been boiled and chickpeas that sit in &quot;aqua fava&quot; (literally: bean water).

- If this spice mix is low, talk to a Chef about it. Some of these ingredients come from a specialty provider with an indented delivery schedule - and will need to be ordered several days in advance in order to allow for proper prep time.

Any questions - Ask Chef!</Recipe>
	<Recipe id="P-44083" image="">ALLERGENS: N/A

Prep:

- Basically, this is a bound gel of sweetened Tamarind Paste. 1 Jar is 300g, so the recipe is built around that.

- Fresh Tamarind, which isn&apos;t very widely available here in North America, is not very tart at all like Tamarind Paste. Citric Acid, other additives, and industrial processes force it to be this way - so it needs to be let out and sweetened. Allspice in this recipe is used to mask some of the bendinf that this ingredient must go through. 

- Place all ingredients into a Vitamix. Keep Xanthan Gum aside.

- Start the Vitamix, and slowly raise the speed setting until you&apos;re working with a fine mixture of all of the aforementioned ingredients. On &quot;High&quot; (the button to the left of the speed setting nob), remove the plunger from the pitcher base, and add the Xanthan Gum while the mixture is moving. 

- You should know, with this recipe, and all recipes requiring a binder like Xanthan Gum, how a thickener is doing in its job. To test this mixture, turn the Vitamix off, and dip the plunger into the mixture, then raise it to see how slowly it falls off the plunger. It should fall slowly. If it doesn&apos;t, add more Xanthan Gum binder, and continue. The idea is that this will become like a paste that will get things dipped into it.

- Don&apos;t worry - if you thicken it too much, you can always go backwards and let it out again, easily. This is not like over-cooking a steak. That said, know what you&apos;re looking for, and do it.

- Label / Date / Store Appropriately...

Any questions - Ask Chef!</Recipe>

Note: as a general rule, it is best to put sauces on the Burrito right after the rice stage. If you put the sauces on last, or at the top (facing the customer) of the burrito - it will be a mess when you&apos;re done.  It&apos;s a good technuique to put the cabbage, cheese, or arugula at the top of the burrito (facing the customer) before rolling it, as this will keep your hands clean, and help you save on glove waste.

Method:
1.Drain Cannelini Beans. The Yield on these beans has been calculated in this recipe - roughly the loss of over a Kilogram in &quot;Aqua Fava&quot;. A quick rinse is valued, but not entirely necessary. 
2.Half all Grape Tomatoes. You will notice in this recipe that 5 LBS is the measured amount require. This is because each box of Grape Tomatoes that comes in from Freshpoint is 10 LBS - meaning: use half of a box for this recipe. Easy enough?
3.Small Dice yellow Onions. Saute with Cumin and Cayenne, adding 1 Bag of Frozen Corn and Red Pepper to the mix along the way. Do not roast this Corn in the oven for any reason - its starches develop and it becomes tough texturally. Deglaze this mixture with Apple Cider Vinegar, and season.

- Pick Oregano. Don&apos;t bother picking the Cilantro, as some stem is fine in this recipe. Rough Chop both of these, and reserve to add into the rest of this recipe.

- Label / Date / Store Appropriately...


NOTE: This recipe will last if properly refrigerated for up to 5 days. This is a large batch for this item, since it&apos;s new to the menu and may not sell well depending on diner preferences. Do not make more than this until it&apos;s proven that it will move. Waste not want not!</Recipe>

Notes:

This recipe should be as green as possible - meaning: stewing the green elements of this recipe too far will kill the flavour and visual appeal of the recipe. The idea of this recipe is to have a flavourful earthy base to balance out the fats present in the Paneer (which is to be added last). 

Prep:

- Cut the root ends off of the Green Onions, and then grill them until coloured. Cool, and then chop up in pieces that are no less than 3 inches long.

- Rough Chop Onions, and begin cooking them out immediately. Throw in Spices, Garlic, and Ginger. Deglaze with water. Season and simmer for 5-10 minutes. 

- Cut Paneer into mouthful-sized cubes - nothing too big. It will cut like Tofu, but it will also flake off, as it does not have gypsum as a binder, and soy proteins are different from milk fat proteins.

- Add HALF of the Spinach in the recipe, and cover for 5 minutes. You want the Spinach to be cooked out, but not to the point of bitterness. At this point, the recipe is very close to being taken off heat.

- Add the Cilantro in this recipe. Then, using an Immersion Blender, puree the Spinach and its juices into a sauce. This does not have to be a uniform puree as it would come out of a Vitamix - a little bit of texture is OK. Check for seasoning.

- Add Chopped Green Onions (grilled), Paneer, the other half of the Spinach, and the Cilantro - season again to taste using the salt in this recipe. Turn off heat.

- Add Yogurt before moving this recipe into Hotel Pans for serving.

Any questions? - Ask Chef... </Recipe>
