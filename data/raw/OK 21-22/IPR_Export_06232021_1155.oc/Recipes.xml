        CHEF TO DO THIS WITH YOU ONCE BEFORE TRYING IT ON YOUR OWN.

        2. Mandoline Shallots into thin rings - Approx. 2mm.

        3. Created a Salt/Water Brine at 10% salt (100g Salt: 1000ml Water). Soak mandolined Shallots in Brine for 10
        minutes. Rinse once with clean water, and let rest for 20 minutes.

        4. At 325-350F, fry Shallots until golden. Shallots will continue cooking once you take them out - and set them
        on a tray lined with paper towel. IMPORTANT: as soon as you take the Shallots out of the fryer, and onto their
        blotting surface of paper towel, you will need to move them around so that they don&apos;t clump up and form
        balls or nests (which, once dried, will not come apart easy). THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GETTING A GOOD PRODUCT.
