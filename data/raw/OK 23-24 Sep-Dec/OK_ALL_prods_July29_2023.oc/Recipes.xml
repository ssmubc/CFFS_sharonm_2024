Notes: 

This is a batch recipe for 1 PORK BELLY, AS THEY COME FROM CENTENNIAL. ONE MORE TIME - A PORK BELLY FROM CENTENNIAL, AFTER TRIMMING AND COOKING, REDUCES TO 3.5KG. 

Prep:

- This recipe should take 2 days - no more, no less, however, the curing process can be elongated, depending on time, to 3-4 days.

- TO CURE: Take Sesame Oil, Brown Sugar, and Salt - and rub the Pork Belly down thoroughly. Place in a Hotel Pan, SKIN SIDE DOWN, and let the sugar and salt begin drawing out moisture and breaking down the outside of the Belly. IMPORTANT: in the morning, when you come in for your shift the next day - TURN THE PORK BELLY OVER, SO THAT THE SKIN SIDE IS UP AND OPEN TO THE AIR. 

- Pre-Heat the Convection Oven to 325F/180C.

- Cover Pork Belly with remaining ingredients, and roast for 25 minutes. Then, turn the oven to 425F, and finish for and extra 10-15 minutes. 

- Given the fat on the Pork Belly, there&apos;s a little room for error here. Don&apos;t get too comfortable, but know that this is a &quot;BASE RECIPE&quot; - therefore, something else will happen with this recipe as soon as you&apos;re done these steps. 

- Once Pork Belly is cool, remove its skin layer. This can be reserved for other applications, but only if time permits (SO GET YOUR MISE EN PLACE DONE EARLY, AND ASK CHEF TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING). Cut, and prepare for next steps.

2. Process Cucumbers. These should be pulsed in the RoboCoupe. PULSED - NOT LEFT ON TO BECOME A SOUP. What you want is something about the consistency of a small dice. When this is done, transfer this mixture into a bowl with Cheese Cloth. RING OUT AS MUCH WATER AS YOU CAN. THIS WATER IS DELICIOUS. I RECOMMEND DRINKING IT FOR ITS ELECTROLYTE PROPERTIES. Unfortunately, it just doesn&apos;t belong in the Yoghurt in this recipe, as it would turn into Cacic.

3. Combine lemon juice and garlic. Let sit for 10 minutes. Salt this mixture to &quot;cook out&quot; the garlic as much as possible.

NOTES: It&apos;s important to note that this is an opportunity for using old or slightly old Cucumber! For instance: look at the recipe for Taboulleh Salad Mix - Cucumber cores should be saved, and then processed and strained in Cheese Cloth for this recipe - otherwise it will be too watery.

In Turkey, there is a dish known as Cacic - a watery version of Tzatziki. The ingredients are more or less the same. What we know as Tzatziki is actually made with Labneh, which is pressed Yoghurt. Since we use regular Yoghurt in this recipe, we have to limit the amount of water content in it, otherwise it will be an undesirable AND low-quality product.

Method:

1. Prepare all Mise En Place items that are dry, and combine. Sift together if you have time.

2. Add Egg, and 50% of the water, and mix with a whisk. 

3. Then, add the vinegar, and continue mixing. A chemical reaction will occur at this point between the vinegar and baking soda. 

4.If necessary, add the remaining water. Otherwise, do not, and let the mixture be by itself. It should be roughly the consistency of soft serve ice cream.

NOTE: This batter should be stored in the freezable containers in the Vegetable Containers, meant for squeeze bottles and other things that stand at room temperature.

[This is where I would normally write &quot;Label/Date/Store!&quot;, but since this is made several times per day, and never stored overnight - the container NOTE was written instead.]

	<Recipe id="P-41464" image="">ALLERGENS: GLUTEN (HOISIN)

Prep:

- Assemble: Black Cardamom, Star Anise, Coriander Seed, Cinnamon, and Nutmeg. Toast spices until fragrant, and then create a Sachet D&apos;Epices with it, using cheesecloth and cooking twine.

- Pick: Celery Leaves, and Cilantro leaves from Stems. Keep the Stems of the Cilantro and the Celery Leaves separately (together). The Celery Stalks will be used in the making of the stock; the Cilantro Leaves will be used as garnish when serving; the Cilantro Stems and Celery Leaves will be added to the final step of the stock as aromatics. 

- Peel Daikon completely and cut into 2&quot; round pieces. Do the same with the White Onions in this recipe. Grill both of these until blackened on both sides - essentially burnt. This is important to the process.

- Place these burnt Daikon and Onion pieces into a large hotel pan, and then add: Cabbage, Garlic, Ginger, and Celery Stalks. Steam for 30 minutes, allowing water to accumulate in the hotel pan throughout the process.

- Fill the Steam Kettle with the 50 L of water in this recipe. Turn on, and begin heating.

- When the steaming ingredients are done, add to the Steam Kettle. When this is done, bring the mixture to a boil, and add the Sachet D&apos;Epices. At this point, add Soy Sauce, Tamarind Paste, Brown Sugar, and Rice Vinegar.

- This stock can be done overnight, but it is not necessary. It should reach a boil for an hour - at least - and then it should reduce to a simmer, and be left for at least 2 hours. During the simmering process, salt can be added to taste. 200 grams are listed in the recipe, but this is an approximation.

- When heat is reduced to a simmer, add Cilantro Stems and Celery Leaves, and turn heat off all together. Allow these to steap for half an hour at least, and give the mixture a good stir before straining.

Method:

1. PRE-SOAK Beans overnight!
   - 2 X 20L CAMBRO Containers
   - HALF of the Beans in Each
   - Filled with 12L of Water Each

2. Drain beans from their hydration liquid. Your cooking water should be different from your soaking water.

3. Using the small steam kettle, cook beans slowly in 20 extra liters of water. They should be good to start at 250F.

4. Cook the beans until they are soft, but not decomposing. During the cooking process it is important to skim off the foamy protein that will accumulate at the surface of the cooking beans&apos; water - this, if unchecked, will lead to a poor bitter taste and a lesser shelf life for the beans themselves.

5. While the beans are cooking, saute your onions in oil, until dark brown. Caramelize them as far as they will go, and then add cumin and garlic. Saute cumin and garlic for 5 minutes, and then take off heat.

6. Turn off steam kettle when the beans are cooked, and let beans sit. Take 4L of the cooking water, and set aside.

7. Drain beans, and then transfer them into a neutral container greater than 40L in volume. Get the large Immersion Blender.

8. Add the onion mixture with the garlic and cumin, as well as half of the salt, and half of the brown sugar. The remaining halves - set aside, and use to SEASON TO TASTE. 

9. With the Immersion Blender, blend about 4L of the bean mixture into a puree - and then add back into the rest of the beans, and mix. Add reserve liquid from the cooking, until you get - not a soup - beans with a puree of more beans.

Prep:

- Quarter Corn Tortillas. 2.5 Packages of Corn Tortillas will yield 2 Deep Hotel pans full of Corn Chips.

- Using Paper Towel, create a large pan or bowl for draining the excess oil off of the Tortilla Chips, after they&apos;ve come out of the Deep Fryer.

- At 350 Degrees (F) in the Deep Fryer, fry NO MORE THAN HALF OF A STACK OF CORN TORTILLAS (QUARTERED) at a time.

- Using a Spider, or Long Tongs - KEEP TORTILLAS MOVING AT ALL TIMES. 

- Depending on how dark the Deep Fryer oil is, fry the Tortilla Chips until they are brown (keeping in mind that they will cook for a little while longer once they&apos;ve been taken out of the fryer. 

- As soon as the chips are out drying, salt lightly using the Windsor coarse grain salt. The salt will only stick during this stage of production - be sure to catch it!

Prep:

- THIS RECIPE IS A TOUGHT ONE; CRISPY SHALLOTS ARE AN ART FORM. PLEASE FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY, AND GET CHEF TO DO THIS WITH YOU ONCE BEFORE TRYING IT ON YOUR OWN.

- Mandoline Shallots into thin rings - Approx. 2mm.

- Created a Salt/Water Brine at 10% salt (100g Salt: 1000ml Water). Soak mandolined Shallots in Brine for 10 minutes. Rinse once with clean water, and let rest for 20 minutes.

- At 325-350F, fry Shallots until golden. Shallots will continue cooking once you take them out - and set them on a tray lined with paper towel. IMPORTANT: as soon as you take the Shallots out of the fryer, and onto their blotting surface of paper towel, you will need to move them around so that they don&apos;t clump up and form balls or nests (which, once dried, will not come apart easy). THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GETTING A GOOD PRODUCT.

- Any questions (especially with this recipe, as the yield is low), PLEASE ASK CHEF!

- Small Dice Red Onions. Saute with Cumin and Cayenne, adding 1 Bag of Frozen Corn and Red Pepper to the mix along the way. Do not roast this Corn in the oven for any reason - its starches develop and it becomes tough texturally. Deglaze this mixture with Apple Cider Vinegar, and season.

- Pick Oregano. Don&apos;t bother picking the Cilantro, as some stem is fine in this recipe. Rough Chop both of these, and reserve to add into the rest of this recipe.

- Label / Date / Store Appropriately...


NOTE: This recipe will last if properly refrigerated for up to 5 days. This is a large batch for this item, since it&apos;s new to the menu and may not sell well depending on diner preferences. Do not make more than this until it&apos;s proven that it will move. Waste not want not!</Recipe>

	<Recipe id="P-44410" image="">ALLERGENS: MILK (PANEER)

Notes:

This recipe should be as green as possible - meaning: stewing the green elements of this recipe too far will kill the flavour and visual appeal of the recipe. The idea of this recipe is to have a flavourful earthy base to balance out the fats present in the Paneer (which is to be added last). 

Prep:

- Cut the root ends off of the Green Onions, and then grill them until coloured. Cool, and then chop up in pieces that are no less than 3 inches long.

- Rough Chop Onions, and begin cooking them out immediately. Throw in Spices, Garlic, and Ginger. Deglaze with water. Season and simmer for 5-10 minutes. 

- Cut Paneer into mouthful-sized cubes - nothing too big. It will cut like Tofu, but it will also flake off, as it does not have gypsum as a binder, and soy proteins are different from milk fat proteins.

- Add HALF of the Spinach in the recipe, and cover for 5 minutes. You want the Spinach to be cooked out, but not to the point of bitterness. At this point, the recipe is very close to being taken off heat.

- Add the Cilantro in this recipe. Then, using an Immersion Blender, puree the Spinach and its juices into a sauce. This does not have to be a uniform puree as it would come out of a Vitamix - a little bit of texture is OK. Check for seasoning.

- Add Chopped Green Onions (grilled), Paneer, the other half of the Spinach, and the Cilantro - season again to taste using the salt in this recipe. Turn off heat.

- Add Yogurt before moving this recipe into Hotel Pans for serving.

Notes: 

BEFORE YOU READ THIS RECIPE - WHICH IS SHORT, BY THE WAY - PLEASE READ THE &quot;PORK BELLY BASE&quot; RECIPE. IT WILL TELL YOU THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK. 

This recipe, really, is just a reminder for portioning, and that, THE &quot;BLACK GARLIC PORK BELLY&quot; ON THE PRODUCTION SHEETS IS REALLY JUST PORK BELLY WITH &quot;BLACK GARLIC SAUCE&quot; ON IT.

ALSO: 1 KG OF PORK BELLY SHOULD GET YOU 10 PORTIONS --&gt; PORTIONS ARE 100 GRAMS EACH.

Prep:

- After completing the &quot;PORK BELLY BASE&quot; Recipe, simply cut up the Pork Belly into 100g Portions - 2 or 3 PCS EACH - and then slather with Black Garlic Sauce. 

- You shouldn&apos;t be concerned about Food Safety issues with this recipe - especially the Black Garlic Sauce - BUT, IF YOU ARE, just send your slathered Pork Belly (in Black Garlic Sauce) into the Convection Oven for a few minutes at 400F or above, to burn it into the Pork.

4. Prepare the egg custard mixture by adding the eggs to a large measuring cup. Add the heavy cream, then add the milk, salt and pepper.

5. Blend with a hand mixer to ensure the egg and cream mixture is completely homogenous (mixed thouroughly)

6. Spread the desired fillings on the bottom of the pie crust. Pour the egg mixture on top (leave a 1/2 cm of head space at the top of the quiche as the eggs will souffle and expand) Bake at 350 degrees for about 20-25 minutes (check after 15 mins)  The quiche will be slightly wobbly in just the center.(this allows for carry over cooking and will set up within a few minutes of exiting the oven)

Method:

1.Place all your rice noodles in a deep mixing bowl, (trying to snap as few of them as possible as you remove them from the package). Bring a good amount of water to boil. Pour the boiling water over the rice noodles until they are completely submerged. 

2.  Stir constantly to prevent clumping/sticking. When they are completely limp, give them a taste to see if they’re cooked through. The thread-like vermicelli noodles  will cook through in just a few minutes. The flat rice noodles might take upwards of ten minutes depending on thickness. Pay attention and test the noodles frequently because they’ll become mushy if they overcook.

3. Once the noodles are tender, drain them and run them under cool water to stop the cooking. Toss them with a small bit of sesame oil to keep the noodles from sticking to each other if you’re not going to use them right away. 

4. The noodles will be used in a stir-fry dish like pad thai, you definitely want to under-cook them a little bit. They will absorb more moisture and cook the rest of the way through once in the stir fry. If your noodles are perfectly cooked to start, they will turn to mush in the stir fry. 

NOTE: Even with a bit of sesame oil, the noodles still tend to clump up after you drain them. They will loosen again once you mix the noodles into your dish

1. Gather all ingredents. Using a larger pot than you think you will need (caramel expands and foams up once you add the cream to the hot sugar mixture) Caramel is a fast process and you cannot walk away from it. if you don&apos;t work fast once the sugar is ready, it will burn.Scale out all ingredents make sure the butter is cubed and cold.

2. Add Water and sugar to a heavy bottom sauce pan. turn on medium high heat DO NOT WALK AWAY. This recipe needs undevided attention.

3. Allow sugar to fully disolve. As the sugar melts, stir vigerously with a whisk or wooden spoon (nothing plastic or it will melt!) reduce heat once the sugar has fully melted.

3. once the sugar has melted stop stiring (you can swirl the pan but do not stir with a utensil)

4. As soon as the sugar turns to a dark amber colour, remove from heat and ad the cold butter, whisk until the butter is melted. Once butter is fully melted, add the heavy cream (using caution as hot steam will happen and the cream will foam up considerably) Whisk until smooth and homogenous(well blended) Let Cool! once cool enough to pour into a cambro do so, but let sit out without a lid until reaches room tempature.

Method:

1. In a large pot bring the water to a boil. Add the rice, lentils, bayleaf and 1/2 the salt. Bring back to a boil, turn heat down to medium and lid, leaving lid slightly ajar.
Simmer for 30-35 minutes or until the rice and lentils are tender. Drain, reserving at least 1 1/4 C (281g) of cooking liquid (it will be used later to make the sauce). Place the rice and lentils back in their cooking pot, lid and set aside off heat.

2. *A note about the veggies. Be sure they&apos;re diced small, otherwise they&apos;ll be crunchy-ish at the end of cooking. We&apos;re looking for them to be soft.

3. In a large Rondeau add the oil and heat until shimmering.  Add the bell pepper, onion and celery. Turn the heat to low. Stir. Cook, stirring occassionally for about 12-15 minutes. The veggies are done when the they&apos;re tender/soft and brown bits (fond – the brown bits that stick to the bottom of the pan) are just starting to appear in the pan. 

4. To the pan of veggies, add the tomato paste, garlic, Cajun or Creole seasoning and remaining 1/2  salt. Stir to coa the veggies. Pour in 3/4 C (180g) of the reserved cooking liquid from the lentils and rice. Stir.

5. To the pan, add the drained kidney beans. Stir. Heat should be on medium-low to low. Lid the pan and gently cook the beans through for about 8-10 minutes. Check on the beans a few times while cooking and If needed, add just a bit more cooking liquid from the reserved liquid. Your beans should be saucy, and moist, not dry.

6. Turn the heat to low and transfer the drained rice and lentils to the bean mixture. Add Worcestershire sauce. Add the lemon juice and to taste for seasoning, adjust if necassary;  then gently fold all the ingredients together.
If needed, to loosen the mixture or if it starts to get too dry, add a splash of cooking liquid - you&apos;ll probably not use it all - thats okay. Taste for salt. Lid. Leave on low heat for 3-5 minutes just to warm though, checking to make sure it isn&apos;t sticking - the pan should be almost dry, with a moist (but not sticky) rice mixture.

HOT HOLD/SERVE

Method:

1. PRE-SOAK Beans overnight!
   - 2 X 20L CAMBRO Containers
   - HALF of the Beans in Each
   - Filled with 12L of Water Each

2. Drain beans from their hydration liquid. Your cooking water should be different from your soaking water.

3. Using the small steam kettle, cook beans slowly in 20 extra liters of water. They should be good to start at 250F.

4. Cook the beans until they are soft, but not decomposing. During the cooking process it is important to skim off the foamy protein that will accumulate at the surface of the cooking beans&apos; water - this, if unchecked, will lead to a poor bitter taste and a lesser shelf life for the beans themselves.

5. Remove from kettle and spread out on roasting pans to cool quickly. Use cooked beans for recipe, or store in appropriate container.</Recipe>
