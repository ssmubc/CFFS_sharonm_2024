	<Recipe id="P-27397" image="">ALLERGENS: MUSTARD, NON-HALAL (WINE IN THE MUSTARD).

Notes: 

This is not a traditional Vindaloo, but no one really has a good idea of what Vindaloo is - really. Many British adopters of Indian cuisine, when it hit England, didn&apos;t know that they were eating a Vindaloo made by predominantly Sri Lankan immigrants that the British just assumed were Indian. These immigrants from Sri Lanka, who ended up being lumped into British society as essentially a sub-brand of Indian people, were largely different from the majority of East Indians because they mostly Muslim. 

The dish was originally a cultural mash-up that was born out of Portuguese colonial influence in Goa. It was originally made with Pork and Wine Vinegar -but, since Sri Lankans are mostly Muslim, the dish became wine-less and pork-less (Lamb, Goat, and Beef stepped in to create what most now understand as what the dish should be), and was hence reborn under the name Vindaloo in 1950&apos;s/60&apos;s Britain as what people assume it to be today. Like many Indian dishes, it has a rich history - just lesser known, in its essential details, than others. This recipe for the base paste is somewhere between its original ethos, and its modern twists.

Prep:

- THE NIGHT BEFORE: Open up the can of Roasted Red Peppers. Add Chili Flakes, and Red Wine Vinegar. Soak overnight. You can also put together your spices the day before - this would be wise, no?

- THE DAY OF: Process Onions however you&apos;d like. This mix will be puree&apos;d once it&apos;s cooked out.

- Begin to cook out Onions. Caramelization is fine - high heat is best. Toast Spices. Add Garlic and Ginger - cook those out. Add Dijon Mustard, and cook out slightly. Then! Add Water, and let simmer. Add soaked mixture of Roasted Red Peppers, Chilis, and Vinegar, from th previous day.

- Simmer for 30-45 minutes, and then puree with an Immersion Blender until it becomes a fine paste. 

- Label / Date / Store Appropriately...

***This recipe can be made in advance in large batches, and then vac-packed and frozen for future use.

Any questions? - Ask Chef...

Prep:

- This recipe should take 2 days - no more, no less, however, the curing process can be elongated, depending on time, to 3-4 days.

- TO CURE: Take Brown Sugar, and Salt - and rub the Pork Belly down thoroughly. Place in a Hotel Pan, SKIN SIDE DOWN, and let the sugar and salt begin drawing out moisture and breaking down the outside of the Belly. IMPORTANT: in the morning, when you come in for your shift the next day - TURN THE PORK BELLY OVER, SO THAT THE SKIN SIDE IS UP AND OPEN TO THE AIR. 

- Pre-Heat the Convection Oven to 325F/180C.

- Cover Pork Belly with remaining ingredients, and roast for 25 minutes. Then, turn the oven to 425F, and finish for and extra 10-15 minutes. 

- Once Pork Belly is cool, remove its skin layer and discard. Cut the meat, and prepare for next steps.

Method:

1. Zest and juice your 2 lemons.

2. Finely chop dill.

3. Process Cucumbers. These should be pulsed in the RoboCoupe. PULSED - NOT LEFT ON TO BECOME A SOUP. What you want is something about the consistency of a small dice. When this is done, transfer this mixture into a bowl with Cheese Cloth. RING OUT AS MUCH WATER AS YOU CAN. THIS WATER IS DELICIOUS. I RECOMMEND DRINKING IT FOR ITS ELECTROLYTE PROPERTIES. Unfortunately, it just doesn&apos;t belong in the Yoghurt in this recipe, as it would turn into Cacic.

4. Combine lemon juice and garlic. Let sit for 10 minutes. Salt this mixture to &quot;cook out&quot; the garlic as much as possible.

5. Fold all ingredients into one another. Taste for Salinity, Acidity, and add honey if the Sweetness needs a little kick.

NOTES: It&apos;s important to note that this is an opportunity for using old or slightly old Cucumber! For instance: look at the recipe for Taboulleh Salad Mix - Cucumber cores should be saved, and then processed and strained in Cheese Cloth for this recipe - otherwise it will be too watery.

In Turkey, there is a dish known as Cacic - a watery version of Tzatziki. The ingredients are more or less the same. What we know as Tzatziki is actually made with Labneh, which is pressed Yoghurt. Since we use regular Yoghurt in this recipe, we have to limit the amount of water content in it, otherwise it will be an undesirable AND low-quality product.

Prep:

- Roasting Grape Tomatoes: Lightly Oil, Roast @ 400 for 5-8 minutes. Skins should be blistered, but bodies still intact.

- Grilling Avocados: Cut the avocado from pole to pole around its pit, and de-pit. Lightly oil the inside of the avocado with your finger, and salt. Grill on high heat - face down - for 4-6 minutes. Leave like this in your Mise En Place, and spoon out as necessary into Magda&apos;s Late Night Menu bowls.

- Frying Chickpeas: if you can&apos;t simply hydrate chickpeas overnight and fry them from beginning to end in the deep fryer, then you&apos;re going to have to use chickpeas from a can. Doing this is fine, but you&apos;ll have to make sure that you fry them until almost all of their moisture is gone - and this can take a while. An under-fried chickpea will go soft and unpleasant very quickly in a fridge. So, please fry adequately, and then drain properly on paper towel after frying to remove excess oils, and salt lightly.

Prep:

- Cut all vegetables into large pieces. Do not spend more than 10 minutes cutting these vegetables, as all of them will be discarded, and no one will see your lovely cuts if you put effort into them.

- Heat a pot in the background with a small amount of oil. You can even start this process with water if you want. Start cooking out anything in the onion family first - this approach can be used with all stock making.

- Once you&apos;ve cooked out your onions (can no longer smell gas coming off of them, and you start to smell sugars coming from them), then add all remaining ingredients EXCEPT CILANTRO - as well as water - and bring to a boil. 

- When the pot is at a boil - let boil for about 20 minutes. Then, turn it down to a simmer. ADD CILANTRO (stocks and all), simmer for 40 minutes with salt, and take off heat. Once off heat, let rest for 45 minutes to an hour, and strain using the fine chinois.

- Label / date / store appropriately.</Recipe>

Method:

1. Prepare all Mise En Place items that are dry, and combine. Sift together if you have time.

2. Add Egg, and 50% of the water, and mix with a whisk. 

3. Then, add the vinegar, and continue mixing. A chemical reaction will occur at this point between the vinegar and baking soda. 

4.If necessary, add the remaining water. Otherwise, do not, and let the mixture be by itself. It should be roughly the consistency of soft serve ice cream.

NOTE: This batter should be stored in the freezable containers in the Vegetable Containers, meant for squeeze bottles and other things that stand at room temperature.

[This is where I would normally write &quot;Label/Date/Store!&quot;, but since this is made several times per day, and never stored overnight - the container NOTE was written instead.]

	<Recipe id="P-41444" image="">- PRE-SOAK Beans overnight!
   - 2 X 20L CAMBRO Containers
   - HALF of the Beans in Each
   - Filled with 12L of Water Each

- Using the Small Steam Kettle, Cook Beans slowly in 20 extra liters of water. They should be good to start at 250F.

- Make a &quot;Sachet D&apos;epices&quot; (Sac of Spice) using cheesecloth - contain the Bay Leaf and Garlic in them, and allow them to steep for the duration of cooking with the beans.

- Cook the beans until they are soft, but not decomposing. During this process it is important to skim off the foamy protein that will accumulate at the surface of the cooking beans&apos; water - this, if unchecked, will lead to a poor bitter taste and a lesser shelf life for the beans themselves.

- Turn off Steam Kettle when the beans are cooked, and let beans sit. Take 4L of the cooking water, and set aside.

- Drain beans, and then transfer them into a neutral container greater than 40L in volume. Get the large Hand Blender / Immersion Blender.

- Add the remaining ingredients - Olive Oil, Fennel, Salt, Lemon (ZEST AND JUICE, BUT BE CAREFUL OF SEEDS), and add in the 4L of reserved cooking water until the desired consistency is reached. 

- The mixture should be a puree - not a soup, but, keep in mind that it will set significantly when it is cool versus warm/hot.

Prep:

- Assemble: Black Cardamom, Star Anise, Coriander Seed, Cinnamon, and Nutmeg. Toast spices until fragrant, and then create a Sachet D&apos;Epices with it, using cheesecloth and cooking twine.

- Pick: Celery Leaves, and Cilantro leaves from Stems. Keep the Stems of the Cilantro and the Celery Leaves separately (together). The Celery Stalks will be used in the making of the stock; the Cilantro Leaves will be used as garnish when serving; the Cilantro Stems and Celery Leaves will be added to the final step of the stock as aromatics. 

- Peel Daikon completely and cut into 2&quot; round pieces. Do the same with the White Onions in this recipe. Grill both of these until blackened on both sides - essentially burnt. This is important to the process.

- Place these burnt Daikon and Onion pieces into a large hotel pan, and then add: Cabbage, Garlic, Ginger, and Celery Stalks. Steam for 30 minutes, allowing water to accumulate in the hotel pan throughout the process.

- Fill the Steam Kettle with the 50 L of water in this recipe. Turn on, and begin heating.

- When the steaming ingredients are done, add to the Steam Kettle. When this is done, bring the mixture to a boil, and add the Sachet D&apos;Epices. At this point, add Soy Sauce, Tamarind Paste, Brown Sugar, and Rice Vinegar.

- This stock can be done overnight, but it is not necessary. It should reach a boil for an hour - at least - and then it should reduce to a simmer, and be left for at least 2 hours. During the simmering process, salt can be added to taste. 200 grams are listed in the recipe, but this is an approximation.

- When heat is reduced to a simmer, add Cilantro Stems and Celery Leaves, and turn heat off all together. Allow these to steap for half an hour at least, and give the mixture a good stir before straining.

   - 2 X 20L CAMBRO Containers
   - HALF of the Beans in Each
   - Filled with 12L of Water Each

2. Drain Beans from their hydration liquid. Your cooking water should be different from your soaking water.

3. Using the Small Steam Kettle, Cook Beans slowly in 20 extra liters of water. They should be good to start at 250F.

4. Cook the beans until they are soft, but not decomposing. During the cooking process it is important to skim off the foamy protein that will accumulate at the surface of the cooking beans&apos; water - this, if unchecked, will lead to a poor bitter taste and a lesser shelf life for the beans themselves.

5. While the beans are cooking, saute your onions in Canola Oil, until dark brown. Caramelize them as far as they will go, and then add Cumin and Garlic. Saute Cumin and Garlic for 5 minutes, and then take off heat.

6. Turn off Steam Kettle when the beans are cooked, and let beans sit. Take 4L of the cooking water, and set aside.

7. Drain beans, and then transfer them into a neutral container greater than 40L in volume. Get the large Hand Blender / Immersion Blender.

8. Add the Onion mixture with the Garlic and Cumin, as well as half of the Salt. The remaining halves - set aside, and use to SEASON TO TASTE. 

9. With the Hand Blender / Immersion Blender, blend about 4L of the bean mixture into a puree - and then add back into the rest of the beans, and mix. Add reserve liquid from the cooking, until you get - not a soup - beans with a puree of more beans.

Prep:

- Quarter Corn Tortillas. 2.5 Packages of Corn Tortillas will yield 2 Deep Hotel pans full of Corn Chips.

- Using Paper Towel, create a large pan or bowl for draining the excess oil off of the Tortilla Chips, after they&apos;ve come out of the Deep Fryer.

- At 350 Degrees (F) in the Deep Fryer, fry NO MORE THAN HALF OF A STACK OF CORN TORTILLAS (QUARTERED) at a time.

- Using a Spider, or Long Tongs - KEEP TORTILLAS MOVING AT ALL TIMES. 

- Depending on how dark the Deep Fryer oil is, fry the Tortilla Chips until they are brown (keeping in mind that they will cook for a little while longer once they&apos;ve been taken out of the fryer. 

- As soon as the chips are out drying, salt lightly using the Windsor coarse grain salt. The salt will only stick during this stage of production - be sure to catch it!

PREP RECIPE

- For a busy night, this recipe will have to be multiplied by 4-5. 

- The cheese slices in this recipe (calculated in the Prep portion of the recipe build) are to be cut in half: assuming that this recipe will yield about 52 tacos with 50 grams of this mixture - each taco should have half a slice of cheese. The cheese is not to be worked into this Prep recipe until assembly.

- Over open flame, or on the grill, blister the exteriors of the Poblano Peppers. Let rest in a bowl covered in plastic wrap for 15-30 minutes in a warm place. 

- Once steamed, the Poblano&apos;s skins should rub off nice and easy. At this point, take their seeds out, and cut them in thick ribbon strips.

- Prepare Mise En Place: spices, garlic, salt, and lime juice. Also, trim all of the cremini mushrooms 

- Small Dice Onions, and sweat them out almost to the point of caramelization. Add mushrooms and garlic. Once mushrooms are cooked out, add spice, lime juice, and salt to taste.

- For service, this mixture can be held in the hot hold, or a bain marie unit or in a makeshift bain marie over heated surface.

	<Recipe id="P-42717" image="">ALLERGENS: GLUTEN, NOT HALAL (BEER/STOUT, LAMB)

Notes: 

It is important to separate this recipe into 4 parts: Lamb, Sauce, Vegetables, and Dumplings (See Recipe). It is also important to note that this dish is full of carbohydrates, and that it is a stand-alone dish – know this when serving, when the students are free to ask questions (that you should know the answers to).

Prep:

- Start by getting the Lamb (3/4” Dice) into Deep Hotel Pans for braising. Pre-heat an oven to 325F, and talk to your co-workers about using that oven for 3-4 hours. Each Hotel Pan should be able to accommodate at least 7.5Kg of Lamb – up to 10Kg. You want to leave space in these braising pans for lots of water, and stout. Each pan should have AT LEAST 8 litres of water for braising – and should be uncovered for best results for the first 2 hours.

- After 2 hours of braising, take the foil off the top of the braising pans, and stir thoroughly.

- Check after 3 hours again, and see if the Lamb is nice and tender. You don’t want the Lamb to be falling apart, but you do want it to have shed some of its toughness. If the Lamb is not done, check every 20-30 minutes, stirring more often, until desired tenderness is achieved.

- Remove braising Lamb from the oven – and when cool, drain off the liquids in the braise, and downsize into a smaller number of pans.

- Put the braising liquid in a fridge to cool, which will allow the Lamb fat to separate from the stock that should be your other braise bi-product. You will make a Roux with the Lamb fat.

- The Sauce will start simply, as most sauces do. Get your Onions, Celery (3Kg for Sauce: 3Kg for Vegetables), Garlic, and Leek – rough chop them, and begin sautéing – Onions and Garlic first. Once the Garlic and Onions are cooked out – add the reserved Lamb liquid to the mixture, and let simmer.

- You may need to add a little more water to this. Don’t worry – it will have enough flavour. You want to make as much of this Sauce as you can, since this is a big batch size.

- Once this Sauce is boiling, use the Roux that you made out of the Lamb fat, and the Immersion Blender, to blend the Roux into the sauce to thicken it. You will want to turn the heat down on this pot, as the Roux will be tempted to burn if you do this on high heat. Within a few minutes, the gluten will cook out, and you’ll know the thickness of your sauce shortly after that. Season then, to taste.

- Meanwhile, begin processing the Vegetables and Herbs for this recipe in the background. Have the Herbs picked. The Vegetables can be cut in advance, and even cooked off in advance.

- All of the Vegetables – Parsnips, Rutabaga (Turnip), and Celery – would be best steamed until cooked, and then roasted at 350F in the Convection ovens for 15-20 minutes.

- When these are done, they can be set aside to be combined with everything else in this next step.

- When combining everything – Dumplings, braised Lamb, Vegetables, Sauce – the last things to add will be the herbs, and the peas. The peas will add a small amount of moisture and flavour to the batch, and the Herbs will finish it off. Go overboard on the herbs, making sure that everything that is ordered is in this recipe, and not waiting to die in our Produce Fridge’s shelves. The more herbs – the better!

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 

2. Dock the bottom of the pastry (to allow air to escape so it doesn&apos;t bubble) Bake the crust for about 5-10 minutes.

3.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool. The crust will be golden. but not not too dark. (as it will bake again with custard/filling

4. Prepare the egg custard mixture by adding the eggs to a large measuring cup. Add the heavy cream, then add the milk, salt and pepper.

5. Blend with a hand mixer to ensure the egg and cream mixture is completely homogenous (mixed thouroughly)

6. Spread the desired fillings on the bottom of the pie crust. Pour the egg mixture on top (leave a  1/2 cm of head space at the top of the quiche as the eggs will souffle and expand) Bake at 350 degrees for about 20-25 minutes (check after 15 mins)  The quiche will be slightly wobbly in just the center.(this allows for carry over cooking and will set up within a few minutes of exiting the oven)

7.  Allow to cool for about 20 minutes to room temperature. Quiche can be served warm, cold, or room temperature.

Prep:

- This Prep section has more to do with the reason that this recipe has been made than methodolgy. If you are a UBC Culinarian, it is assumed that you can put together a salad. However! - use a scale and weigh out these ingredients, since visualizing these weights will be important to cost control via portion control - please and thanks!

- This recipe is considered a template recipe. It will typically be a side salad, included in &quot;plated&quot; (assembled with multiple mandatory components) dishes, but will be costed out to be a full salad (@ X 3) for uses elsewhere in the menu. This recipe has been weighed out to the gram.

- The reason that there are 2 types of Cucumber in this recipe is that UBC acquires its Cucumbers from both BC and Mexico over the year. We also acquire Cucumbers from VFMD and UBC Farm - but we typically get them from Freshpoint, our produce purveyor. If this recipe is pushed through the system calculating for equal usage of both products (under different Item Codes in OC), then a ratio of consumption will theoretically be possible by September of 2019.

Prep:

- Basically, this is a bound puree of Cilantro and Mint. All of the other ingredients in this recipe are more there for context.

- Place all ingredients (and, it&apos;s OK to use ground coriander in this recipe, even without toasting it)(don&apos;t worry, other flavours in this recipe will pick up where it otherwise would have done its thing) into a Vitamix. Keep Xanthan Gum aside.

- Start the Vitamix, and slowly raise the speed setting until you&apos;re working with a fine puree of all of the aforementioned ingredients. On &quot;High&quot; (the button to the left of the speed setting nob), remove the plunger from the pitcher base, and add the Xanthan Gum while the mixture is moving. 

- Keeping in mind while you&apos;re doing this that the base of the Vitamix will heat up, causing your greens inside this puree to become bitter and discolour. Therefore, it&apos;s best if this it done quickly - but do not sacrifice quality for haste! 

- You should know, with this recipe, and all recipes requiring a binder like Xanthan Gum, how a thickener is doing in its job. To test this mixture, turn the Vitamix off, and dip the plunger into the mixture, then raise it to see how slowly it falls off the plunger. It should fall slowly. If it doesn&apos;t, add more Xanthan Gum binder, and continue. The idea is that this will become a paste that will get things dipped into it.

- Don&apos;t worry - if you thicken it too much, you can always go backwards and let it out again, easily. This is not like over-cooking a steak. That said, know what you&apos;re looking for, and do it.

Prep:

- Chop all Shiitake Mushrooms in the same size as the &quot;Food Service&quot; Mushroom mix from FreshPoint.

- Cut the bases off the Shimeji Mushrooms and pull them apart. They should be fine long as they are - cut once (half) if need be, but no more than that.

- Using the Wok, on high heat - drop all mushrooms in, and add a splash of water to get them moving. Add Salt, Pepper, and Canola Oil. Then, add Ginger, Garlic, and Mirin.

- Once cooked out, add Sesame Oil, and turn off heat. Mushrooms should be able to get a little burn on them. Taste to see if more Salt is needed.

- These items can be vac-packed and frozen for future use. This mixture should be made at least once every two weeks.

PREP RECIPE

Assemble all ingredients.

1. Char onions, ginger, leek whites, daikon and cabbage in that order. 

2. While your veggies are charing, fill your kettle with 60L and pop in the Kombu and let it steep in warm water for 30 minutes. Take the Kombu out and save for Miso Soup.

3. Sautee your charred ginger and garlic. Add onions, leeks and celery.

4. Add sauteed veggies to the kettle and start filling with the rest of the water, leaving room for the Daikon and Cabbage. - Start heating up kettle to boil.

5. While the kettle is coming to temp, add Umami Dust - and any MUSHROOM ENDS that may be around. Some tomato ends are acceptable too.

6. Once the Daikon and Cabbage are done charring, cut into large chunks.

7. When Broth comes to a boil, turn it down to a very low simmer and add the daikon, cabbage and nori sheets. Season a bit at this stage too, as it helps draw out the flavour of the veggies.

8. If you are leaving the broth over night, you can add all the leek ends and any random cilantro/parsley/green onion ends to the broth while on low heat. If you are finishing it on the same day, then add the green ends at the end and let steep for 30 min before straining etc...

To finish.

1. Scoop all the veggies out.
2. Re-up with water and bring to a boil.
3. Turn down the kettle and add add 1 jug of soy sauce, taste and add more salt/pepper as needed.
4. Put through fine strainer and cool.

Prep:

- Take the Coriander Seeds, Cumin Seeds, Ajwain Seeds, Black Pepper and Garam Masala - and toast, then grind in the Vitamix into a fine powder. The toasting, as mentioned in other recipes, is key to developing flavour and aroma.

- Amchur Powder is not a spice, but a powder made of green mango. It should not be toasted. Opinions differ on this, but - for this recipe, do not toast this ingredient.

- Normally this recipe would be made into a paste with lemon juice and a small amount of water. We use this as a more dry rub, in combination with alread-wet ingredients like potatoes that have been boiled and chickpeas that sit in &quot;aqua fava&quot; (literally: bean water).

- If this spice mix is low, talk to a Chef about it. Some of these ingredients come from a specialty provider with an indented delivery schedule - and will need to be ordered several days in advance in order to allow for proper prep time.

Any questions - Ask Chef!</Recipe>
	<Recipe id="P-44083" image="">ALLERGENS: N/A

Prep:

- Basically, this is a bound gel of sweetened Tamarind Paste. 1 Jar is 300g, so the recipe is built around that.

- Fresh Tamarind, which isn&apos;t very widely available here in North America, is not very tart at all like Tamarind Paste. Citric Acid, other additives, and industrial processes force it to be this way - so it needs to be let out and sweetened. Allspice in this recipe is used to mask some of the bendinf that this ingredient must go through. 

- Place all ingredients into a Vitamix. Keep Xanthan Gum aside.

- Start the Vitamix, and slowly raise the speed setting until you&apos;re working with a fine mixture of all of the aforementioned ingredients. On &quot;High&quot; (the button to the left of the speed setting nob), remove the plunger from the pitcher base, and add the Xanthan Gum while the mixture is moving. 

- You should know, with this recipe, and all recipes requiring a binder like Xanthan Gum, how a thickener is doing in its job. To test this mixture, turn the Vitamix off, and dip the plunger into the mixture, then raise it to see how slowly it falls off the plunger. It should fall slowly. If it doesn&apos;t, add more Xanthan Gum binder, and continue. The idea is that this will become like a paste that will get things dipped into it.

- Don&apos;t worry - if you thicken it too much, you can always go backwards and let it out again, easily. This is not like over-cooking a steak. That said, know what you&apos;re looking for, and do it.

NOTES: I would prefer that this recipe be done in a Rondeau, and not the Combi Oven. If it must be done in the Combi Oven, the spice mixture with the Onions and Garlic (method below) should be cooked out before being mixed with the Rice and Accompaniment - stirred at least twice during the cooking process.


Prep:

- Small Dice Yellow Onions.

- Fine Chop the Preserved Lemon rinds. Cut the pith (white part) out of each, down to the zest only. Any pith that makes it into this recipe will spoil the flavours. Please take extra special care during this part of the process.

- Use Puree&apos;d Garlic. Rough Chop Cilantro bunches, but do not add until the very end. Assemble spices.

- Using the Canola Oil in this recipe, begin to sautee the onions - cook them out, and add spices when they are done.

- Add Rice to sautee-ing Onions, and Spices. Garlic can be added at this stage - seasoning as well.

- Toast off Rice slightly, and then add water. At this point, add Sultana Raisins, Preserved Lemon, and Bay Leaf. Slowly raise to a boil (or do by Combi oven after these steps), and then cover with a lid, lower temperature, and let cook patiently for 25-30 minutes (this will depend on how far you toast out the Rice).

- If you are doing this in the Combi Oven, please make sure to saute the Onions out, the Spices, Garlic, and then add the remaining ingredients into the water that you use when you go to cook the Rice out. Cooking out the Onions and Spices in this recipe are key - Raisins, Preserved Lemon and Cilantro can and should be added very last prior to service.

- THIS ITEM SHOULD BE MADE ONCE IN THE MORNING AND ONCE AT NIGHT. THIS IS NOT AN ITEM THAT CAN SIT IN THE WARMERS ALL DAY - A PRACTICE THAT MUST BE STOPPED. IT SHOULD NOT BE MADE TOO FAR IN ADVANCE, AS IT WILL BECOME WASTE AND CANNOT REALLY BE RECYCLED.

Method:

1.Drain Cannelini Beans. The Yield on these beans has been calculated in this recipe - roughly the loss of over a Kilogram in &quot;Aqua Fava&quot;. A quick rinse is valued, but not entirely necessary. 

2. Half all Grape Tomatoes. You will notice in this recipe that 5 LBS is the measured amount require. This is because each box of Grape Tomatoes that comes in from Freshpoint is 10 LBS - meaning: use half of a box for this recipe. Easy enough?

3. Small Dice yellow Onions. Saute with Cumin and Cayenne, adding 1 Bag of Frozen Corn and Red Pepper to the mix along the way. Do not roast this Corn in the oven for any reason - its starches develop and it becomes tough texturally. Deglaze this mixture with Apple Cider Vinegar, and season.

- Pick Oregano. Don&apos;t bother picking the Cilantro, as some stem is fine in this recipe. Rough Chop both of these, and reserve to add into the rest of this recipe.

Prep:

- Cut Potatoes into EQUAL SIZED pieces. This is not as important as the sizing on the Harra Potatoes recipe, since we&apos;re going to cook these ones in the Combi Oven, and then finish them off in the Convection Oven. Most of the work will be done in the Combi Oven. 

- Really, this is a simple one. Cook your Potatoes out on the Steam (212F) setting on the Combi Oven. Do this until they&apos;re done - 30+ minutes.

- Once the potatoes are done, take them out and put them into a large mixing bowl, wherein you will add your Salt, Garlic, Sumac, and Thyme. Yeah, don&apos;t worry about the Thyme going in there whole. Don&apos;t even de-sprig it - once it roasts, it will fall off its sprigs, and then you can pull them out easily (try not to serve them to students, but, if a student gets one - no big deal; tell them to talk to the Chef).

- Tray these potatoes up, and Roast them off at 400F in the Convection Oven until browning. Do not roast them to the point where the Garlic is burning, but just shy of that point.

- Rough Chop your Arugula. Toss in at the very end, when your Potatoes (which are now ROASTED, like, no one will know that they were in the Combi Oven first...) are cooling down but still have enough heat left in them to wilt the Arugula.

Prep:

- Taking a Peeler, gently remove the zest from the Lemon and the Orange in long strips. Take half the juice from each, and set aside for the next step.

- Mandoline Garlic cloves thinly, and set into the juice of the orange and lemon to acidify. These will be added like this directly to the mixture - so, the thinner: the better.

- Steep the Thyme on low heat in the Olive Oil for 5 minutes. Afterwards, set aside oil to cool.

- Combine all ingredients. 


NOTE: When these Marinated Olives come out of the fridge, the oil herein will have congealed. This leads to very unattractive presentation issues. Please temper any mixture you bring out - and don&apos;t bring out too much at a time that might lead to unnecessary waste.

Notes: This is not a super-traditional Raita, just in case you were curious to know whether or not it was. Raita can vary in many ways based on where it&apos;s from - some even contain fruit! In order to make this stand out, in comparison to our Tzatziki, we will be using Ginger as an accent, and Cilantro, as well as Sev.


Prep:

- Using the Mandoline with the Medium &quot;teeth&quot; attachment, process the Zucchini into fine threads. Salt, and let sit for 25 minutes. The Salt will &quot;cook&quot; it, and break it down so that it will melt into this mixture.

- Puree Ginger. This can most likely be taken from the Ginger and Garlic purees in the Prepped Items Cooler. Combine this with the Lemon Juice and Sugar. Let this sit for 10 minutes.

- In a blanket of Cheese Cloth, drain all of the liquid from the Zucchini - give it a good squeeze to try and get all of the excess liquid (and Salt) out. Toss it in the Cardamom and Cayenne.

- Rough Chop Cilantro. 

- Combine all other ingredients, and TASTE. Adjust for Salinity and Acidity. Ask Chef to taste. Then, TASTE AGAIN.

NOTES: 
This recipe should be as green as possible - meaning: stewing the green elements of this recipe too far will kill the flavour and visual appeal of the recipe. The idea of this recipe is to have a flavourful earthy base to balance out the fats present in the Paneer (which is to be added last). 

Prep:

1. Cut the root ends off of the Green Onions, and then grill them until coloured. Cool, and then chop up in pieces that are no less than 3 inches long.

2. Rough Chop Onions, and begin cooking them out immediately. Throw in Spices(toast spices) Garlic, and Ginger. Deglaze with veg stock. Season and simmer for 5-10 minutes. 

3. Cut Paneer into bite-sized cubes - nothing too big. It will cut like Tofu, but it will also flake off..

4.  Add HALF of the Spinach in the recipe, and cover for 5 minutes. You want the Spinach to be cooked out, but not to the point of bitterness. At this point, the recipe is very close to being taken off heat.

5.  Add the Cilantro. Then, using an Immersion Blender, puree the Spinach and its juices into a sauce. This does not have to be a uniform puree as it would come out of a Vitamix - a little bit of texture is OK. Taste &amp; check for seasoning.

6. Add Chopped Green Onions (grilled), Paneer, the other half of the Spinach, and the Cilantro - season again to taste using the salt in this recipe. Turn off heat.

7. Add Yogurt before moving this recipe intoserving pans. Reserve for service.

	<Recipe id="P-44443" image="">ALLERGENS: N/A (BUT THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL)

Notes:

The most important part of this recipe is how to treat the fat that comes off of the Ground Beef when it’s sautéed – it must be drained off, and reserved for a slurry of sorts that’s made with potato starch nearer to the end of the recipe. If the fat is left in this recipe, it becomes a sloppy mess once it interacts with the tart shell that it is to go into.

Prep:

- Rough Chop Celery, Carrot, and Leek – process them in the RoboCoupe until they are roughly the size of a brunoise (a Mirepoix, but with Leek). DO NOT PROCESS THESE ITEMS INTO A PUREE.

- With the Spices involved in this recipe, cook out the Ground Beef. Drain off fat – reserve.

- In a Rondeau, sweat out the Leek Mirepoix. At the same time, pick your herbs and give them a rough chop – remember, do not bruise them by chopping up and down, instead use the knife you have like a saw with long back and forth strokes. You want to cook this mirepoix out fast and not too far – it just needs to lose some moisture.

- In the same Rondeau, add your Ground Beef back in with the mirepoix. Then, add your Maple Syrup. Then – after checking the seasoning – add your herbs, and then take off heat.

- Take your reserved fat from before, and put it in a pan, and put that pan on heat. Slowly add your potato starch to it – not all of it may be necessary depending on how much fat you pulled from the Ground Beef. You want to make a glue with this mixture, and then add it back into the Tourtierre mixture. Throw in a little Black Pepper if you find that the Allspice doesn’t come through.

- Mix thoroughly. Fill into 4” Tart Shells. Thaw tops, and use a fork to tamp down the edges of the Tart Shells to seal it shut. Egg wash is not used in this recipe to avoid listing that as an allergen, and also to cut a step. That said – use a knife to mark an X into the centre of each one to allow air to escape.

Tourtierres can be frozen (immediately after making, preferably), but are best kept in the fridge.

PREP RECIPE

Chop root veg. 

Pick and chop thyme. 

***Roast beets separately so that they don&apos;t dye everything red

Toss the potatoes, carrots and parsnips in the garlic oil, salt and pepper and chopped thyme. 

Toss the beets with the same garlic oil, salt and pepper and chopped thyme, but separately. 

Roast veggies in the oven until they are softened and sweet and golden brown around the edges. </Recipe>
	<Recipe id="P-44450" image="">
Notes:

This recipe involves essentially making a stock from the Pork Bones inside the Festive Hams, and then discarding them – but keeping the Pork. The rest of the recipe is pretty easy.

Prep:

- Cut all of the Pork off of the Festive Hams, and small dice it, then set it aside. 

- Roast Pork Bones in the Convection Oven for 30 minutes at 425F of above.

- Rough Chop Mirepoix vegetables: Onion, Carrot Celery. Make a Sachet D’epices with the Bay Leaf and Thyme.

- With a separate pot of water, cook out your Yellow Split Peas until they are done – approximately half an hour. This can be done on low heat, with minimal supervision. Add more water than is necessary, and top it up as the Split Peas expand.

- While those cook out, start sauteeing your Mirepoix vegetables. When they are cooked out, add the water, your Sachet, and make a stock – tossing in the roasted Pork Bones from the Convection Oven. Raise to a boil and then simmer for an hour or so. Discard Pork Bones and Sachet at this point, and add half of your cooked out Split Peas.

- You can add all of the other ingredients in the recipe at this point. Then, using an Immersion Blender, puree this mixture into a soup. Then, add your small diced Festive Ham, the other half of your Split Peas, and then season to taste.

- Add a slight acidity to it with the Apple Cider Vinegar, and again season to taste.

- Cool rapidly when off heat – this is a high protein dish, and will spoil faster than others.

	<Recipe id="P-44565" image="">ALLERGENS: SOY, SESAME

Notes: 

This is a Wok-style recipe of Singaporean heritage. It is a rare dry curry - combining the Indian influences and the Chinese influences specific to Singapore. In Singapore it would have Prawns, Chicken, and Egg in it - these are considered Allergens to us and have therefore been avoided. Also, it&apos;s important to note that the name of this dish is loosely just the name of the Noodle itself - Singapore Bihon is like &quot;Hokkien Mee&quot;, or &quot;Hokkien Noodle&quot;.

Prep:

- Soak Bihon Noodles. Prepare Curried Tofu and Curried Chicken - recipes included in this binder.

- Prep all Vegetables with a stir-fry cut that will allow for them to be easily incorporated into the rice noodle whose name is loosely &quot;Bihon&quot; (Bee-Hoon). This noodle cooks quickly once it is soaked, and can be challenging to NOT tear up into a million tiny pieces through carelessness. It is most important to have this Mise En Place avaialble.

- Aggressively Wok Fry all vegetables - not Ginger and Garlic - in Canola Oil. Do not be afraid of a little colour. NOTE: You will have to multiply these volumes in order to make enough for services. These volumes should be seen as what should go into each plate. Notice this recipe&apos;s unit of measurement is &quot;PTN&quot; (Portion). Set aside these vegetables when finished.

- Using a Large Rondeau, start sautee-ing Garlic and Ginger on high heat, and then add soaked Noodles and Curry Powder. Add a little bit of water to create steam to finish off the noodles. Add Vegetables - and a small amount of Cornstarch Slurry - then tray for service. This, combined with Tofu or Chicken, AND Lime and Sprouts - will make a plate of Bihon Noodle. DO NOT OVER-PREPARE THIS DISH, AS ITS QUALITY WILL DEGRADE THE HIGHER IT IS SCALED OUT. 

Any questions? Ask Chef...
</Recipe>
	<Recipe id="P-44567" image="">ALLERGENS: N/A

Notes:

This is a vegetable mix for the Singapore Style Bihon Noodle. It&apos;s a base mix that can be steamed off lightly before being fried in the wok on high heat - and then assembled in a Rondeau with the Noodles and &quot;Sauce&quot; component. 

The &quot;Sauce&quot; for the Bihon is actually more of a dry rub. There is no rubbing in this recipe - maybe it&apos;s best described as a dry spice mix that all of the component ingredients are tossed with.

After this process, there is another component - the fresh component: Bean Sprouts, Chopped Chilis, Coriander, and Fresh Lime Juice. Prawns and eggs are traditionally added to this - because: Singapore. 


Any questions? - Ask Chef... </Recipe>
	<Recipe id="P-44569" image="">ALLERGENS: SOY, SESAME

Notes:

This is a &quot;Sauce&quot;, in how it&apos;s used in this recipe, but not in terms of what you might think of when you hear the word &quot;Sauce&quot;. 

This dish is a dry spiced quasi-curry, with history specific to Singapore. In Singapore, the dominant population is Chinese, second to Indian and Malay people. Malay people have a wonderful array of curry-based dishes, and a mostly Muslim population which has its own spice character that is distinct to it in relation to India and its spice profiles. 

This sauce contains a small amount of Corn Starch, which is to be used in it as a slurry, in order to properly coat the contents of this dish. It is not authentic in that regard, but, in the batch sizes that we&apos;ll be making, it is a necessity.

As you might expect - all of the ingredients in this recipe are to be cooked out, and formed into a paste to be used to start off each batch of Bihon. Cooking instructions will be included in the Product Recipe associated with this dish.

***Tajin Spice has been found in excess at Place Vanier, and will be used. This will be considered a back-up plan in case we run out of it.

Notes:

This mixture is meant to simulate the famous &quot;Tajin&quot; Spice Mix that exists in Mexico and other parts of Central and South America. The only thing this imposter spice is missing is lime-infused salt - Citric Acid has been employed to make sure that it isn&apos;t missed much. 

Bonus Points: to create lime-infused salt, simply zest 6 limes (for this recipe), and dehydrate overnight on a bed of Kosher Salt, and blitz up the next day in the Vitamix. If anyone actually does this - Chef will be impressed. 

Prep:

- Combine all ingredients. Mix up until uniformly dispersed.

Prep:

- Garlic and Ginger - use the Pre-Minced products that are available in the prepped items fridge.

- Cut 1/3rd of a packet of Red Thai Chilis. Each packet that we get from Freshpoint is 300g.

- Large Dice: Cabbage, Onions,  

- Heat the Wok. This side can be done at the station for effect or in the back, in hiding. 

Either way --&gt; THIS IS AN ITEM THAT SHOULD NEVER SIT IN OUR WARMERS, AS IT WILL LOOK HORRIBLE (WORSE THAN THE FACE THAT CHEF WILL MAKE IF THEY FIND IT IN THE WARMERS AT ANY POINT, OR BEING DONE AN HOUR BEFORE SERVICE), AND THE FLAVOURS WILL DEGRADE IMMENSELY.

- Starting with the Onions - in the hot Wok - begin to fry these ingredients. Spoiler - this is going to happen fast, and you&apos;re really just going to want to put some colour on the onions, before throwing in the Cabbage and deglazing with 2 Cups of Water. When you do this, throw in your Ginger and Garlic 

- Add remaining ingredients, and bring to a boil. Immediately turn off heat at this point, and while it&apos;s still at a boil, make a Corn Starch Slurry out of your remaining Cup of Water in this recipe - adding it slowly while stirring. At this point, you&apos;re pretty much done. 

- It would be best to do this infront of the students, as it will draw attention to the amazing job you&apos;re doing and the flavours that you&apos;re representing.

Notes:

Sushi Rice is never made in a Combi Oven in Japan. That doesn&apos;t matter. It can be simulated well enough to a respectable standard. I would prefer to have this made in a Rondeau, with a higher water ratio than what&apos;s suggested in this recipe, however, when you use the steam function in the Combi Oven you have to use a 1:1 ratio because of the excess humidity in the oven&apos;s chamber. Timing on this will depend on how many times the oven is opened and closed during the cooking process relative to other items being prepped - a suggested number will be put forth below. 

Prep:

- Rinse Rice 3 times, or until the water from it becomes clear. In many cases, this will take more than 3 passes through COLD water.

- Once the Rice is cleaned, it should be drained effectively, and combined with its 1:1 water ratio for cooking. The steam function on our Combi Ovens, in case it isn&apos;t already going: 100% humidity w/ 212F/100C. Break up Lemongrass, and Slice up Ginger into chunks that you&apos;ll be able to take out after this process is over. DO NOT USE A GINGER PUREE for this recipe. Place the Rice in to steam.

- Combine Mirin, Rice Wine Vinegar and other ingredients into a bowl over ice. Or, place the bowl in the Freezer while the Rice cooks. THIS IS IMPORTANT, as it must help the rice cool down as much as possible, so as not to over-cook.

- Once Rice is cooked - 35+ minutes - take it out, and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the chilled liquid mixture, and mix around until evenly seasoned. BE CAREFUL NOT THE MASH IT UP. THIS IS EASY TO DO, AND WILL LEAD TO A STRANGE PRODUCT.

- Lay down on sheet trays if need be, and place in the fridge to cool down as soon as possible - stopping the cooking process.

Note: 

This is a very simple recipe - combining one with the other. This will be a short write-up. 


Prep:

- Using the Wok, on high heat with the small amount of oil, mark the Beef enough to get a little taste of burning. Again, the colour here will be balanced out by the Bulgogi Sauce - go ahead and burn it a little bit.

- When you&apos;re content that you&apos;ve succeeded in giving the Beef a little burnt flavour, and that&apos;s it&apos;s cooked out, turn off the heat. As the wok is still hot though, add your Bulgogi Sauce, and let the temperature reduce until it&apos;s all ready to come out of the Wok as a mix.

- This is one of those things that you can get BONUS POINTS FROM CHEF for doing ON THE STATION during service or right at the beginning of service. It should NEVER BE DONE IN LARGE BATCHES PRIOR TO SERVICE IN A LARGE BATCH AND HELD HOT DURING SERVICE IN WASTEFUL BATCHES.

Notes: 

This is a simple roast for the Burrito Bar, Bueno - all you need to know is that the Butternut Squash is to be peeled, seeded, and chopped up before roasting. A processed product will not be used in this recipe. Whenever possible, use as much UBC Squash as possible, as there will be an excess of it during the Fall/Winter season to use. UBC Squash cost in the system has been actualized to equal Freshpoint&apos;s cost.


Prep:

- Pre-heat Convection Oven to 375F/190C. 

- Peel, Seed, and Chop Squash into 1&quot; Cubes.

- Toss in Canola Oil, Salt, and Spices.

- Roast for 25 minutes, and then check! Alternatively, these Squash cubes can be steamed for 25-30 minutes, and then tossed in everything - Spices, Oil, Salt, AND Garlic - AND THEN finished in the Convection Oven. 

- If you do not choose to steam the Squash beforehand, then only add the Garlic at the end of the roasting process - so as not to burn the Garlic.

- Roast until tender and cooked through - this will depend on the size of the cut / type of Squash - cool, and ready in the Bueno line in a hot-hold insert.

- Steam 2 Bags of the &quot;7 Bean Medley&quot; (Carb Freezer), and fold into the Roasted Squash as it cools.

Note: as a general rule, it is best to put sauces on the Burrito right after the rice stage. If you put the sauces on last, or at the top (facing the customer) of the burrito - it will be a mess when you go to roll it.  It&apos;s a good technuique to put the cabbage, cheese, or arugula at the top of the burrito (facing the customer) before rolling it, as this will keep your hands clean, and help you save on glove waste.

3) Add the flour through fine mesh chinois while whisking melted butter to insure that no lumps are formed.

4) Stir until the mixture is smooth and with out lumps, this is the time to be more careful. Cook for 1 minute so the flour becomes tastier and absorbs the fats. The roux should be a nice golden colour.

5) Add warm milk to roux in a steady stream, whisking continuously. Simmer on low heat until it starts to thicken, but insure it does not come to a boil. Whisk in the salt and pepper mix, and nutmeg, taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Set aside for recipe.

Preps used in this Product recipe:

Method:

1.Place all your rice noodles in a deep mixing bowl, (trying to snap as few of them as possible as you remove them from the package). Bring a good amount of water to boil. Pour the boiling water over the rice noodles until they are completely submerged. 

2.  Stir constantly to prevent clumping/sticking. When they are completely limp, give them a taste to see if they’re cooked through. The thread-like vermicelli noodles  will cook through in just a few minutes. The flat rice noodles might take upwards of ten minutes depending on thickness. Pay attention and test the noodles frequently because they’ll become mushy if they overcook.

3. Once the noodles are tender, drain them and run them under cool water to stop the cooking. Toss them with a small bit of sesame oil to keep the noodles from sticking to each other if you’re not going to use them right away. 

4. The noodles will be used in a stir-fry dish like pad thai, you definitely want to under-cook them a little bit. They will absorb more moisture and cook the rest of the way through once in the stir fry. If your noodles are perfectly cooked to start, they will turn to mush in the stir fry. 

NOTE: Even with a bit of sesame oil, the noodles still tend to clump up after you drain them. They will loosen again once you mix the noodles into your dish

KEY ITEM - the cheese needs to be very finely shredded ( &quot;fluffy&quot; in texture ) I am unsure that the cheese listed here will be shredded finely enough.  We need to check this prior to the 14th and ensure that this will work otherwise we need to buy block cheddar and shread it ourselves on a box grator or the finest setting on the robocoup.

Please ensure you add this before simmering. 


Notes: 

Prep:

Saute each of the vegetables (Mushroom, Onion/garlic, leek, parsnip, turnip, potato ) separately with oil, salt &amp; pepper. 

Deglaze the pan with guiness in between each vegetable, reserving the liquid

Once all vegetables are cooked to 70%, start a roux with butter &amp; flour.  Toast until golden
- incorporate the deglazing liquid and stock into the roux using a wand mixer to remove any lumps
- add the vegetables and herbs
- cook over medium heat and simmer until it thickens
- simmer until the flour has &quot;cooked out&quot;
- finish the stew with the peas and parsley
- adjust seasoning and hold for service

- The Sauce will start simply, as most sauces do. Get your Onions, Celery (3Kg for Sauce: 3Kg for Vegetables), Garlic, and Leek – rough chop them, and begin sautéing – Onions and Garlic first. Once the Garlic and Onions are cooked out – add the reserved Lamb liquid to the mixture, and let simmer.

- You may need to add a little more water to this. Don’t worry – it will have enough flavour. You want to make as much of this Sauce as you can, since this is a big batch size.

- Once this Sauce is boiling, use the Roux that you made out of the Lamb fat, and the Immersion Blender, to blend the Roux into the sauce to thicken it. You will want to turn the heat down on this pot, as the Roux will be tempted to burn if you do this on high heat. Within a few minutes, the gluten will cook out, and you’ll know the thickness of your sauce shortly after that. Season then, to taste.

- Meanwhile, begin processing the Vegetables and Herbs for this recipe in the background. Have the Herbs picked. The Vegetables can be cut in advance, and even cooked off in advance.

- All of the Vegetables – Parsnips, Rutabaga (Turnip), and Celery – would be best steamed until cooked, and then roasted at 350F in the Convection ovens for 15-20 minutes.

- When these are done, they can be set aside to be combined with everything else in this next step.

- When combining everything – Dumplings, braised Lamb, Vegetables, Sauce – the last things to add will be the herbs, and the peas. The peas will add a small amount of moisture and flavour to the batch, and the Herbs will finish it off. Go overboard on the herbs, making sure that everything that is ordered is in this recipe, and not waiting to die in our Produce Fridge’s shelves. The more herbs – the better!

Method:

1.  Combine the orange juice, olive oil, cilantro, lime juice, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, cumin, salt, black pepper, jalapeno, and garlic in a large mixing bowl and whisk together until it is well blended.
    Save 250ml of the marinade in a covered container in the refrigerator.

 2. Combine the remaining marinade and steak in a large covered insert. Refrigerate the steak in the marinade for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
 
3.  Preheat your grill to high heat,  Make sure the grill is hot before you start to cook the meat.
 
4. Remove the steak from the marinade and pat dry. Discard any leftover marinade.

5.  Add the steak to the preheated grill and cook for 6 to 8 minutes per side, or until you’ve reached your desired doneness. Note that flank steak tastes best when it is cooked to medium-rare because it’s a lean cut of steak. Use an instant read meat thermometer to check the temperature for accuracy.
 
6. Remove the steak from the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes. Giving the steak time to rest is very important!
    
7. Once the steak has had time to rest for 10 minutes, thinly slice the steak against the grain and serve it with the 250ml of reserved merinade.

**Please note – the cooking time is estimated! This will depend on how thick the steak is. To check the temperature of your meat, Use an instant read thermometer for accuracy. The health board recommends that steak be cooked to an internal temperature of 145F

3. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with remaining oil and the remaining mushrooms; transfer them to the medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and tender, 6 to 8 minutes, lowering the heat as needed to avoid burning. Transfer to the bowl.

4. Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter to the skillet. Once the butter is melted, add the onion, cook until starting to soften, about 5 minutes.

5. Add the kale, garlic, thyme and rosemary, season with salt and pepper and cook out, stirring occasionally, until softened, approx 3 minutes, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons oil if the pan seems dry. Sprinkle with the flour and cook, stirring, until flour is dispersed and lightly toasted, 2 minutes.

6. Stirring constantly, gradually add the stock and  cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes.

Method:

1. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, cumin, and one-third of the salt.(Adjust if altering batch size).

2. Add garlic, ginger, cilantro, and green chilies to Robot coupe to pulse into a paste. Then, add to the pan with the onions.

3. Next add ground coriander, chili powder, and turmeric and stir to coat. Add a little more oil at this point if the pan is looking dry.

4. Next add pureed tomatoes and chickpeas and remaining salt. If the mixture looks a little too thick, add up to 1 cup (250 ml) water. You’re looking for a semi-thick soup consistency at this point, as it will cook down into more of a stew.

5. Increase heat to medium high until it reaches a rolling simmer, then reduce heat to low or medium-low and maintain a simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes, or until thick and stew-like. Stir occasionally.

6. When the chana masala is thickened and bubbly, taste and adjust seasonings as needed, add more salt if needed.

7. Remove from heat and add lemon juice and garam masala. Stir to mix.

Method:

1. Gather all ingredents. Using a larger pot than you think you will need (caramel expands and foams up once you add the cream to the hot sugar mixture) Caramel is a fast process and you cannot walk away from it. if you don&apos;t work fast once the sugar is ready, it will burn.Scale out all ingredents make sure the butter is cubed and cold.

2. Add Water and sugar to a heavy bottom sauce pan. turn on medium high heat DO NOT WALK AWAY. This recipe needs undevided attention.

3. Allow sugar to fully disolve. As the sugar melts, stir vigerously with a whisk or wooden spoon (nothing plastic or it will melt!) reduce heat once the sugar has fully melted.

3. once the sugar has melted stop stiring (you can swirl the pan but do not stir with a utensil)

4. As soon as the sugar turns to a dark amber colour, remove from heat and ad the cold butter, whisk until the butter is melted. Once butter is fully melted, add the heavy cream (using caution as hot steam will happen and the cream will foam up considerably) Whisk until smooth and homogenous(well blended) Let Cool! once cool enough to pour into a cambro do so, but let sit out without a lid until reaches room tempature.

Method:

1. In a large pot bring the water to a boil. Add the rice, lentils, bayleaf and 1/2 the salt. Bring back to a boil, turn heat down to medium and lid, leaving lid slightly ajar.
Simmer for 30-35 minutes or until the rice and lentils are tender. Drain, reserving at least 1 1/4 C (281g) of cooking liquid (it will be used later to make the sauce). Place the rice and lentils back in their cooking pot, lid and set aside off heat.

2. *A note about the veggies. Be sure they&apos;re diced small, otherwise they&apos;ll be crunchy-ish at the end of cooking. We&apos;re looking for them to be soft.

3. In a large Rondeau add the oil and heat until shimmering.  Add the bell pepper, onion and celery. Turn the heat to low. Stir. Cook, stirring occassionally for about 12-15 minutes. The veggies are done when the they&apos;re tender/soft and brown bits (fond – the brown bits that stick to the bottom of the pan) are just starting to appear in the pan. 

4. To the pan of veggies, add the tomato paste, garlic, Cajun or Creole seasoning and remaining 1/2  salt. Stir to coa the veggies. Pour in 3/4 C (180g) of the reserved cooking liquid from the lentils and rice. Stir.

5. To the pan, add the drained kidney beans. Stir. Heat should be on medium-low to low. Lid the pan and gently cook the beans through for about 8-10 minutes. Check on the beans a few times while cooking and If needed, add just a bit more cooking liquid from the reserved liquid. Your beans should be saucy, and moist, not dry.

6. Turn the heat to low and transfer the drained rice and lentils to the bean mixture. Add Worcestershire sauce. Add the lemon juice and to taste for seasoning, adjust if necassary;  then gently fold all the ingredients together.
If needed, to loosen the mixture or if it starts to get too dry, add a splash of cooking liquid - you&apos;ll probably not use it all - thats okay. Taste for salt. Lid. Leave on low heat for 3-5 minutes just to warm though, checking to make sure it isn&apos;t sticking - the pan should be almost dry, with a moist (but not sticky) rice mixture.

Method:

1. Place a large saute pan over a low to medium-low heat. Add the 1 /2 of the oil followed by onion &amp; garlic and reduce heat to low. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the onions are golden brown.

2. Remove the onions from the pan and return the pan to the heat.  Add the spinach and cook until wilted.

3. Remove from the spinach from the pan and leave to cool.

4. Increase the heat to medium/high and return the pan to the heat. Add the remaining oil and place the cleaned mushrooms, top side down. Cook until lightly golden (approx 5 minutes) before turning over and cooking for a further 5 minutes or until golden. Remove from the heat, and drain on paper towel top side up as they will release a lot of liquid as they cool. 

5. Transfer the onions, spinach and mushrooms to the refrigerator and cool completely. 

6. Preheat the oven to 390F. On a parchment lined pan place the puff pastry sheet on top. Spread half the caramelized onions over the middle third of the pastry, making sure to leave an extra 2cm border at the edge of the pastry. Top with half of the baby spinach. Spread the dijon mustard over the mushrooms and season well with salt and pepper. Place the mushrooms on top of the spinach. Top the mushrooms with thyme and the remaining baby spinach and onions.

7. Very carefully roll the pastry over the top of the mushroom mixture until you have a log. Press down to seal the edges. Roll over the log so that the seam is facing the bottom.

8. Whisk eggs together to make an egg wash . Very lightly coat the outside of the pastry log with the egg wash. Place the pastry in the freezer for 10 minutes before repeating with another layer of egg wash and freezing the pastry for a further 10 minutes.

9. Bake in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden and flakey. Reserve for service.

Method:

1.Combine the barley and stock:  in a hotel pan. Add salt and pepper.

2.  Cook In steamer.  Keep an eye on the  barley as it will give off a lot of foam at first and can  boil over.

3. For pearl barley, start checking at 25 minutes. The barley is done when it has tripled in volume and is soft yet chewy. Add more water if the pan becomes dry before the barley has finished cooking; check every 5 minutes until desired chewiness is reached.

4. Drain the barley (if necessary): When the barley is done, it will have absorbed most of the water. If there is a little water still left in the pan, just leave the barley to sit for 10 minutes, covered, until it has all been absorbed. If there is a lot of water left, drain the barley in a strainer over the sink.

5. Fluff the barley!  With a fork, fluff the barley to separate the grains. this is an imprtant step with all our steamed grains!

It may be necessary to add a little hot water if the mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.

3. When mixture is thick and smooth, add Tofu and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat, 20 to 30 minutes. There should only be a little very thick sauce left when the biryani is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the sauce.

RICE:

1. Wash rice well and drain well for at least 30 minutes.

2. Heat remaining oil in a large rondeau. Fry onion in hot oil until golden. Add saffron, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and rice. Stir continuously until rice is coated with spices.

3. Heat stock and salt in a pot. When the mixture is hot, pour it over the rice and stir well. Add the chicken mixture and quartered potatoes; gently mix them into the rice. Bring to boil. Cover the saucepan tightly, turn heat to very low, and steam for 20 minutes. Do not lift lid or stir while cooking!

Method:

1. Grind spices. reserve. On a pachment lined baking sheet, roast the tomatillos in a 400F ove until splotchy black and thoroughly soft, about 5 minutes per side. Scrape into a large bowl. Add half of the the sesame seeds in with the tomatillos. Reserve the remainder for sprinkling on the chicken.

2. In a very large rondeau heat the veg oil over medium flame. When quite hot, fry the chiles, three or four pieces at a time, flipping them nearly constantly with tongs until their interior side has changed to a lighter color, about 20 or 30 seconds total frying time. Don’t toast them so darkly that they begin to smoke—that would make the mole bitter. As they’re done, remove them to a large bowl, being careful to drain as much fat as possible back into the pot. Cover the toasted chiles with hot tap water and let rehydrate 30 minutes, stirring frequently to insure even soaking.

3. Remove any stray chile seeds left in the fat. With the pot still over medium heat, fry the garlic and almonds, stirring regularly, until browned (the garlic should be soft), about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove to the tomatillo bowl, draining as much fat as possible back into the pot.

4. Add the raisins to the hot pot. Stir for 20 or 30 seconds, until they’ve puffed and browned slightly. Scoop them out, draining as much fat as possible back into the pot, and add to the tomatillos. Set the pan aside off the heat.To the tomatillo mixture, add the cinnamon, black pepper, anise, cloves, heavily toasted bread and chocolate. Add 2 cups water and stir to combine.

5.  Into a large measuring cup, strain off the chiles’ soaking liquid. Taste the liquid: if it’s not bitter, discard all abut 6 cups of the liquid. (if you’re short, add water to make up the shortfall). If bitter, pour it out and measure 6 cups water. Scoop half of the chiles into a blende, pour in half of the soaking liquid (or water) and blend to a smooth puree.

6. Press through a medium-mesh strainer into a large bowl; discard the bits of skin and seeds that don’t pass through the strainer. Repeat with the remaining chiles.

7. Return the roneau to medium heat. When quite hot, pour in the chile puree; it should sizzle sharply and, if the pan is sufficiently hot, the mixture should never stop boiling. Stir every couple of minutes until the chile puree has darkened and reduced to the consistency of tomato paste, about a half hour. 

8. In two batches, blend the tomatillo mixture as smoothly as possible (you may need an extra 250ml of water to keep everything moving through the blades), then strain it in to the large bowl that contained the chiles. When the chile paste has reduced, add the tomatillo mixture to the pot and cook, stirring every few minutes until considerably darker and thicker, 15 to 20 minutes. 

9. Simmer. Add the broth to the pot and briskly simmer the mixture over medium to medium-low heat for about 2 hours for all the flavors to come together and mellow. If the mole has thickened beyond the consistency of a cream soup, stir in a little water. Taste and season with salt and the sugar. Taste for seasoning, adjust as necassary

Method:

1. Heat olive oil in a large, rondeau. once hot, add the diced onions; saute, stirring occassionally, until the onions are soft and starting to brown around the edges.

2. Add the minced garlic, diced red peppers and diced jalapeno and saute until fragrant.
Add the tomato paste, fire roasted tomatoes (driained) cumin, chili powder, paprika, and salt. 

3. Work the tomatos and paste and spices into the vegetables until evenly distributed.

4. Add the riced cauliflower, corn and drained beans to the skillet. Stir, stir, stir until the rice is worked into the skillet ingredients.

5. Continue sautéing, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower releases its moisture and is cooked through, but not completely soft. Be sure to stir frequently so the cauliflower cooks evenly.

6. Once cooked through, remove from heat and stir in the lime juice and cilantro. Taste for seasoning, and adjust as needed with salt, lime juice, or cilantro.

7. NOTE: about texture – depending on the size of the cauliflower rice and how much moistures it contains, the cooking time will vary. The best way to know the rice is cooked is to taste it. Fully cooked cauliflower rice will be chewy, but still a bit firm with a light bite. Overcooked cauliflower rice can be soggy, so pay attention to the pan and start tasting for texture around the 5-minute mark.

Method:

1. Peel the plantains and cut them into 1-inch thick coins.

2. Place in a pot, cover them with cold water, add salt, bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to simmer. Cook until a fork easily slides in and out when you poke a piece of plantain, about 10-15 minutes.

3. Drain the plantains and let them cool until you can handle them. 

4. Place the chunks between two pieces of parchment paper or plastic wrap and lightly smash them with a meat hammer. You want to smush ’em up just enough to make some rough edges; they don’t need to be particularly thin.

5. Heat a large, rondeau or tilt skillet over medium-high heat and warm the oil. (DO NOT PUT IN THE DEEP FRYER)

6.  Add the smashed plantains and brown them on both sides, about 3-5 minutes per side. Sprinkle with a little salt while still hot.

7. Reserve for service.

NOTE: The plantains can be boiled and smashed in advance, then stored in the fridge until you’re ready to crisp them in the pan.

Method:

1. Toast and soak the chiles.  Heat a rondeau over medium heat and, a few at a time, toast the chiles, pressing them flat against the hot surface for several seconds with a metal spatula until they change colour and release their aroma, then flipping and toasting the other side.  Collect into a bowl, cover with hot tap water, weight with a plate to keep them submerged and rehydrate for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove and discard water.

2. Heat the oil in a large pot set over medium-high.  Add the onion and garlic and stir for 5 minutes or so, until the onion is browned a little, but not completely soft.  

3. Remove the pan from the heat and using a slotted spoon, transfer the onion and garlic to a blender or food processor, squeezing them to leave behind as much fat as possible.

4.  Transfer the chiles from their soaking liquid to the blender, add  in the cumin, black pepper and oregano. 

5. Add 700ml of Veg stock and blend/process until as smooth as possible.

6. Set the saucepan back over medium-high heat and when the fat is hot enough to make a drop of puree sizzle sharply, set a medium-mesh strainer over the pot and press the puree through.  Stir for 7 or 8 minutes, until it is darker in color and very thick.  Add the remaining stock, the orange juice and the vinegar.  Simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes or longer to bring the flavors together.
