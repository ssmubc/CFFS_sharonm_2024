Notes:

1. There are 11.36Kg in 25 Lbs. Cases of Chow Mein Noodles come from Fresh Point in 25 Lbs boxes. 

2. From Freshpoint we also get processed and unprocessed vegetables in 5 Lbs bags. This is why the &quot;Bean Sprouts&quot; and &quot;Julienne Vegetables&quot; are in those increments. 

Prep:

- Thaw Chow Mein Noodles if need be. If they need to be ordered, they can be ordered prior to 10:AM from Freshpoint for an afternoon (same day) delivery, but they will most likely come in frozen. It is best to thaw out these noodles a day in advance or more.

- If the noodles need to be thawed in a hurry, the Combi Oven and its steam setting can be employed.

- Once the Noodles are malleable, break them apart (they come in a large block), and tray them up on large Sheet Trays. Then, as evenly as possible, disperse the remaining ingredients over them for seasoning, flavour, and texture. 

- Steam again. Put into service trays - typically Hotel Pans or Half Hotel Inserts - and hold for service. It&apos;s best not to hold these for too long, however, of all of the starches - the Chow Mein does not degrade as quickly as others. That said - do not use this as an excuse to do off too much in advance.

Any questions? - Ask Chef...</Recipe>

Method:

1. Prepare all Mise En Place items that are dry, and combine. Sift together if you have time.

2. Add Egg, and 50% of the water, and mix with a whisk. 

3. Then, add the vinegar, and continue mixing. A chemical reaction will occur at this point between the vinegar and baking soda. 

4.If necessary, add the remaining water. Otherwise, do not, and let the mixture be by itself. It should be roughly the consistency of soft serve ice cream.

NOTE: This batter should be stored in the freezable containers in the Vegetable Containers, meant for squeeze bottles and other things that stand at room temperature.

[This is where I would normally write &quot;Label/Date/Store!&quot;, but since this is made several times per day, and never stored overnight - the container NOTE was written instead.]
