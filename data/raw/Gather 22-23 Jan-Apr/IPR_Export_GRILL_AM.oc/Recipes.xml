Method:
1.Drain Cannelini Beans. The Yield on these beans has been calculated in this recipe - roughly the loss of over a Kilogram in &quot;Aqua Fava&quot;. A quick rinse is valued, but not entirely necessary. 
2.Half all Grape Tomatoes. You will notice in this recipe that 5 LBS is the measured amount require. This is because each box of Grape Tomatoes that comes in from Freshpoint is 10 LBS - meaning: use half of a box for this recipe. Easy enough?
3.Small Dice yellow Onions. Saute with Cumin and Cayenne, adding 1 Bag of Frozen Corn and Red Pepper to the mix along the way. Do not roast this Corn in the oven for any reason - its starches develop and it becomes tough texturally. Deglaze this mixture with Apple Cider Vinegar, and season.

- Pick Oregano. Don&apos;t bother picking the Cilantro, as some stem is fine in this recipe. Rough Chop both of these, and reserve to add into the rest of this recipe.

- Label / Date / Store Appropriately...


NOTE: This recipe will last if properly refrigerated for up to 5 days. This is a large batch for this item, since it&apos;s new to the menu and may not sell well depending on diner preferences. Do not make more than this until it&apos;s proven that it will move. Waste not want not!</Recipe>
