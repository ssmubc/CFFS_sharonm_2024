1. Gather All Ingredients
2. Char onions, ginger, leek whites, daikon and cabbage in that order. 
3. While your veggies are charing, fill your kettle with 60L and pop in the Kombu and let it steep in warm water for 30 minutes. Take the Kombu out and save for Miso Soup.
4. Sautee your charred ginger and garlic. Add onions, leeks and celery.
5. Add sauteed veggies to the kettle and start filling with the rest of the water, leaving room for the Daikon and Cabbage. - Start heating up kettle to boil.
6. While the kettle is coming to temp, add Umami Dust - and any MUSHROOM ENDS that may be around. Some tomato ends are acceptable too.
7. Once the Daikon and Cabbage are done charring, cut into large chunks.
8. When Broth comes to a boil, turn it down to a very low simmer and add the daikon, cabbage and nori sheets. Season a bit at this stage too, as it helps draw out the flavour of the veggies.
9. If you are leaving the broth over night, you can add all the leek ends and any random cilantro/parsley/green onion ends to the broth while on low heat. If you are finishing it on the same day, then add the green ends at the end and let steep for 30 min before straining etc...

To finish.

1. Scoop all the veggies out.
2. Re-up with water and bring to a boil.
3. Turn down the kettle and add add 1 jug of soy sauce, taste and add more salt/pepper as needed.
4. Put through fine strainer and cool.

Notes:

This recipe should be as green as possible - meaning: stewing the green elements of this recipe too far will kill the flavour and visual appeal of the recipe. The idea of this recipe is to have a flavourful earthy base to balance out the fats present in the Paneer (which is to be added last). 

Prep:

- Cut the root ends off of the Green Onions, and then grill them until coloured. Cool, and then chop up in pieces that are no less than 3 inches long.

- Rough Chop Onions, and begin cooking them out immediately. Throw in Spices, Garlic, and Ginger. Deglaze with water. Season and simmer for 5-10 minutes. 

- Cut Paneer into mouthful-sized cubes - nothing too big. It will cut like Tofu, but it will also flake off, as it does not have gypsum as a binder, and soy proteins are different from milk fat proteins.

- Add HALF of the Spinach in the recipe, and cover for 5 minutes. You want the Spinach to be cooked out, but not to the point of bitterness. At this point, the recipe is very close to being taken off heat.

- Add the Cilantro in this recipe. Then, using an Immersion Blender, puree the Spinach and its juices into a sauce. This does not have to be a uniform puree as it would come out of a Vitamix - a little bit of texture is OK. Check for seasoning.

- Add Chopped Green Onions (grilled), Paneer, the other half of the Spinach, and the Cilantro - season again to taste using the salt in this recipe. Turn off heat.

- Add Yogurt before moving this recipe into Hotel Pans for serving.

Any questions? - Ask Chef... </Recipe>
