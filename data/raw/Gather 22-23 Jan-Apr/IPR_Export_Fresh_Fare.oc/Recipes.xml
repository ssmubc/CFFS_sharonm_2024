2. Finely chop dill.

3. Process Cucumbers. These should be pulsed in the RoboCoupe. PULSED - NOT LEFT ON TO BECOME A SOUP. What you want is something about the consistency of a small dice. When this is done, transfer this mixture into a bowl with Cheese Cloth. RING OUT AS MUCH WATER AS YOU CAN. THIS WATER IS DELICIOUS. I RECOMMEND DRINKING IT FOR ITS ELECTROLYTE PROPERTIES. Unfortunately, it just doesn&apos;t belong in the Yoghurt in this recipe, as it would turn into Cacic.

4. Combine lemon juice and garlic. Let sit for 10 minutes. Salt this mixture to &quot;cook out&quot; the garlic as much as possible.

5. Fold all ingredients into one another. Taste for Salinity, Acidity, and add honey if the Sweetness needs a little kick.

NOTES: It&apos;s important to note that this is an opportunity for using old or slightly old Cucumber! For instance: look at the recipe for Taboulleh Salad Mix - Cucumber cores should be saved, and then processed and strained in Cheese Cloth for this recipe - otherwise it will be too watery.

In Turkey, there is a dish known as Cacic - a watery version of Tzatziki. The ingredients are more or less the same. What we know as Tzatziki is actually made with Labneh, which is pressed Yoghurt. Since we use regular Yoghurt in this recipe, we have to limit the amount of water content in it, otherwise it will be an undesirable AND low-quality product.

IMPORTANT: as soon as you take the Shallots out of the fryer, and onto their blotting surface of paper towel, you will need to move them around so that they don&apos;t clump up and form balls or nests (which, once dried, will not come apart easy).

Prep:

- Take the Coriander Seeds, Cumin Seeds, Ajwain Seeds, Black Pepper and Garam Masala - and toast, then grind in the Vitamix into a fine powder. The toasting, as mentioned in other recipes, is key to developing flavour and aroma.

- Amchur Powder is not a spice, but a powder made of green mango. It should not be toasted. Opinions differ on this, but - for this recipe, do not toast this ingredient.

- Normally this recipe would be made into a paste with lemon juice and a small amount of water. We use this as a more dry rub, in combination with alread-wet ingredients like potatoes that have been boiled and chickpeas that sit in &quot;aqua fava&quot; (literally: bean water).

- If this spice mix is low, talk to a Chef about it. Some of these ingredients come from a specialty provider with an indented delivery schedule - and will need to be ordered several days in advance in order to allow for proper prep time.

Any questions - Ask Chef!</Recipe>
	<Recipe id="P-44083" image="">ALLERGENS: N/A

Prep:

- Basically, this is a bound gel of sweetened Tamarind Paste. 1 Jar is 300g, so the recipe is built around that.

- Fresh Tamarind, which isn&apos;t very widely available here in North America, is not very tart at all like Tamarind Paste. Citric Acid, other additives, and industrial processes force it to be this way - so it needs to be let out and sweetened. Allspice in this recipe is used to mask some of the bendinf that this ingredient must go through. 

- Place all ingredients into a Vitamix. Keep Xanthan Gum aside.

- Start the Vitamix, and slowly raise the speed setting until you&apos;re working with a fine mixture of all of the aforementioned ingredients. On &quot;High&quot; (the button to the left of the speed setting nob), remove the plunger from the pitcher base, and add the Xanthan Gum while the mixture is moving. 

- You should know, with this recipe, and all recipes requiring a binder like Xanthan Gum, how a thickener is doing in its job. To test this mixture, turn the Vitamix off, and dip the plunger into the mixture, then raise it to see how slowly it falls off the plunger. It should fall slowly. If it doesn&apos;t, add more Xanthan Gum binder, and continue. The idea is that this will become like a paste that will get things dipped into it.

- Don&apos;t worry - if you thicken it too much, you can always go backwards and let it out again, easily. This is not like over-cooking a steak. That said, know what you&apos;re looking for, and do it.

- Label / Date / Store Appropriately...

Note: as a general rule, it is best to put sauces on the Burrito right after the rice stage. If you put the sauces on last, or at the top (facing the customer) of the burrito - it will be a mess when you&apos;re done.  It&apos;s a good technuique to put the cabbage, cheese, or arugula at the top of the burrito (facing the customer) before rolling it, as this will keep your hands clean, and help you save on glove waste.

1.Drain Cannelini Beans. The Yield on these beans has been calculated in this recipe - roughly the loss of over a Kilogram in &quot;Aqua Fava&quot;. A quick rinse is valued, but not entirely necessary. 
2.Half all Grape Tomatoes. You will notice in this recipe that 5 LBS is the measured amount require. This is because each box of Grape Tomatoes that comes in from Freshpoint is 10 LBS - meaning: use half of a box for this recipe. Easy enough?
3.Small Dice yellow Onions. Saute with Cumin and Cayenne, adding 1 Bag of Frozen Corn and Red Pepper to the mix along the way. Do not roast this Corn in the oven for any reason - its starches develop and it becomes tough texturally. Deglaze this mixture with Apple Cider Vinegar, and season.

- Pick Oregano. Don&apos;t bother picking the Cilantro, as some stem is fine in this recipe. Rough Chop both of these, and reserve to add into the rest of this recipe.

1.If using put strainer in the kettle.  If you don&apos;t know what it looks like, ask someone.  If you can&apos;t find it, ask a dishwasher. You will regret life if you do not do this step. Trust me.

2. Fill large pot or steam kettle with water at least 6x water to pasta ratio, turn heat to high and bring the water to a FULL boil.

3. Once water is boiling reduce heat and add pasta. Stir stir every few minutes to make sure pasta does not stick. Cook until pasta is al dente, soft but with a bit of a bite.
APPROX 7 MINUTES

4. Once pasta is cool drain water and stir in lots of ice and cold water, stir constantly to fully cool all pasta. Once fully cooled drain the water.
